Government Policy Alignment,The A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon Improvement is clearly aligned with the Departments strategic business objectives. It is expected that the scheme will tackle congestion on the roads and improve journey time reliability improve road safety by reducing incident related delays and encourage sustainable local travel by promoting the ethos of the right traffic on the right road,The scheme supports: i) the Government's pledge to identify present and protect World Heritage Sites for future generations after signing UN's Education Scientific & Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Convention; ii) The DfT£s Command Paper Action for Roads vision for the road network and transformational investment to support the economy and the environment; iii) the National Policy Statement for National Networks which sets out Government£s vision and policy for the future development of nationally significant infrastructure projects including a vision for the strategic road network by 2040; iv) the Road Investment Strategy (2015-2020) period 1 where the scheme has committed funding status with construction to begin within this period. ,Response to the Airports Commission's Final Report.  Government decision to increase airport capacity in south-east England (December 2015).,The Crossrail programme supports the achievement of the Department for Transport's key objectives (as summarised in the Crossrail Business Case July 2011):    ,Single Departmental Plan Milestone - Extension of rail services from London Marylebone to Oxford via Oxford Parkway  -   December 2016 .The East West Rail programme supports the achievement of key objectives for DfT DCLG and BIS.  The Department for Transport's key objectives are: Support a transport system that is an engine for economic growth but one that is also greener and safer and improves quality of life in our communities; Improve the links that help to move goods and people around; Secure the sustainability of the railway and create capacity for improvement of services.,"The project fulfils the Secretary of State's rail investment strategy (also known as HLOS) capacity requirement published in 2012 for this area of the network as well as the Manifesto Commitment ""between the years 2014 and 2019 over £38 billion will be invested in Britain£s rail network across operations maintenance and renewals (OMR) and enhancements (infrastructure upgrades)"". The proposal addresses historic under-provision of capacity to meet current demand as well as forecast demand in CP5.  By 2018/19 it is estimated that almost 50% more seats would be needed in the peak morning period into Paddington to accommodate forecast demand (HLOS). Single Departmental Plan 2015-2020 - Boosting economics growth and opportunity and building a One Nation Briton by delivering rail enhancements and investing in the region to improve connections to the South West.",The development of High Speed 2 features prominently in manifesto commitments and forms part of the DfT£s business plan. ,and tackle congestion - IEP will deliver more trains with more seats and faster journeys improving connectivity to and from London and between cities. Support regional economic developments - IEP creates 730 new skilled jobs at Newton Aycliffe in the North East and secures thousands more in the UK supply chain. Make the most of our current infrastructure - IEP uses the electrified railway fully by minimising diesel operation under the wires. The bi-mode capability enables locations off the wires to enjoy the benefits of an electric railway as passengers won't need to change trains and journey times are reduced.,Following a DfT-led public consultation in 2013 the need for a new road crossing in the Lower Thames region was included in the National Infrastructure Plan in 2014.  In addition to addressing the problems caused by congestion and unreliable journeys improvements in road crossing capacity are also required to support economic growth and improve environmental impacts.,The Midland Main Line programme is a Tier 1 programme that is part of the Government's manifesto commitment to deliver over £38 billion of investment in Britain£s rail network across operations maintenance and renewals (OMR) and enhancements (infrastructure upgrades). ,Supports the manifesto commitment with respect to the Northern Powerhouse. Support the regional economic developments- improve efficiency spread demand increase standards  in customer services railway performance and station facilities-improve social inclusion accessibility and modern integration.,Improve the Rail Network and deliver better services to customers by addressing the high running cost of the UK railway compared with other countries; making the most of our current infrastructure; continue to invest in infrastructure such as Crossrail the Intercity Express Programme electrification of the network and tube upgrades and securing improvements to passenger rail services through a programme of rail franchise replacements.  ,The provision of this service is a commitment for the UK Government under the 1979 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation.  In order to meet this obligation and ensure service continuity DfT has successfully put in place a new service completing the military withdrawal in Jan 2016.,lementation Programme is a key plank in the Government's next generation shared service strategy and Civil Service Reform Plan. Divestment of the DfT Shared Service Centre to Arvato in 2013 was the first step in forming the first Independent Shared Service Centre (ISSC1) for providing back office service for DfT and other Government Departments. The Department is now working with the contractor for the migration of its Agencies to a new lower cost enterprise planning (ERP) solution (Agresso).,"The programme is part of the manifesto commitment to ""Improve connections to the South West with major investment in the M5 A358 A30 A303 and the electrification of the Great Western Main Line and bring in new fast trains on the route"". The project together with the related infrastructure works at Waterloo and along the South West Route fulfils the Secretary of State's rail investment strategy (also known as HLOS) capacity requirement published in 2012 for this area of the network. If data is shown in a comparable way these are the most overcrowded train services in Great Britain and are forecast to have continuing high levels of growth. The proposal addresses historic under-provision of capacity to meet current demand as well as forecast demand in CP5.  This is a key concern for SWT.",The Thameslink Programme supports the achievement of the department's key objectives as summarised in the Full Business Case (May 2013):-Tackle capacity constraints grow new markets and support wider housing and economic development plans. Improve efficiency spread demand reduce costs and increase the long term value of the railway - Increase standards in customer services railway performance and station facilities - Improve safety and environmental outcomes - Improve social inclusion accessibility and modal integration.,In line with DfTs single Departmental Plan to roll out new technology and innovation on our transport networks we are investing in digital signalling on the railways so that we can run more services and save money in the long run.,This will enable IT service provision at DVSA to continue to support the delivery of critical public-facing services and achieve compliance with the requirements of the Government ICT Strategy. ,This procurement is in support of the UK Governments Roads Investment Strategy 2015 - 2020,LA major scheme granted Final Approval by Ministers in March 2014.

Departmental DCA Narrative,The Development Consent Order was made by the SoS on 11 March 2016 with the judicial review period passing with no challenges received. Governance papers for full funding have been to and approved by Investment Decision Committee Higways England Board and Board Investment and Commerical Committee. The Ministerial submission has been approved and notification from HMT that funds are available has been received. The full SGAR 5 was held in on 28 June 2016 which achieved a GREEN rating. The I&PA review provisionally booked as a two day review has been cancelled and will not be held; this has been agreed by all parties due to our response to the Feburary 16 review. An AAP review was scheduled but IPA were unable to source one of the reviewers from the previous review due to unavailability (a previous reviewer is required for continuity). Kate Walker IPA Ops Lead talked the requirement through with Chris Taylor and it was agreed that it would not need to be rescheduled (presumed due to confirmation that previous recommendations were being adequately actioned). The project is currently working through a cost assurance exercise with the delivery partners prior to Notice to Proceed being issued. The project is well placed to start works before the December 2016 milestone. The main risks to the overall scheme at present are: H&S risk to workers during construction; Excessive customer delays through road work;County Archaeologist does not relax present requirements; Poor weather in key construction phases; Overheating of construction market; lack of skills materials plant; Client capability to lead and manage project;Unknown impact of the UK referendum to leave the EU,This scheme is in the options phase (Jan 2016-July 2017) having completed PCF Stage 0 in Dec 2015.The overall Amber assessment is based on the early stage of the project and the unique challenge of developing an acceptable economic case. To achieve a Start of Work within RIS 1 period i.e. by end of 19/20 is a very challenging objective for a project of this scale and complexity which can only be achieved if the scheme is the construction of the scheme is publically financed.,Government stated in December 2015 that there is a need to deliver airport expansion in the South East and further work was requested to support Government in identifying a preferred scheme. This work was completed in June 2016 and the planning assumption of an announcement of preferred scheme by Summer 2016 has been put back to at least October 2016 in line with SoS's statement in the House of Commons on 30 June 2016. However given recent political activities the programme team are preparing to be ready as required by Ministers.The planning route to enable increased airport capacity is expected to be through a National Policy Statement. During this period work has also been ongoing to draft a generic airports NPS and consider how best to deliver a consultation on this NPS. This work was due to complete by Summer 2016 and was assured through a PAR completed in June specifically on the challenge of a large consultation on the NPS - Rating: Amber. The scheme planning and construction activities will be delivered by the preferred scheme promoter however DfT will work closely with the promoter to enable the programme and manage dependencies. It is currently presumed that the scheme promoter will fund the scheme and some elements of surface access. No public funding is currently available for direct investment in airports.The key strategic risks are identified as: a) Government's strategic and policy priorities change impacting on airport capacity; b) The impact of Air Quality on the programme and the ability to deliver expansion within legal air quality limits which could result in delayed policy implementation and capacity delivery; c) Delivery and funding of planned or assumed surface access proposals which could result in the full anticipated benefits and generation of additional airport capacity not being realised; and d) Economic regulation framework impacting on the deliverability of any Government decision on airport expansion meaning a change in primary legislation is necessary.The Airport Capacity Programme is novel and contentious and will be subject to continual political public local national and global media interest as well as ongoing opposition and legal challenge.,Overall - Crossrail is scheduled to be completed to time and within budget.Cost - The project is forecast to be completed within budget and cost no more than £14.5bn excluding the rolling stock and depot contract. Within this there are concerns regarding escalating costs particularly on the Network Rail portion of the works. Increased scrutinity and measures to help control costs are being implemented.Schedule - At the end of Period 2 in 2016 Crossrail (CRL) is reporting 75% complete against a plan of 76.6% a variance of 1.6%. The Surface Works delivered by Network Rail are now 65% complete. The Master Operations Handover Schedule (MOHS) was launched during April 2015 and replaces the Master Control Schedule (MCS) as the primary schedule. This is expected to improve the strategic management and integration of activities necessary to deliver Crossrail as an end-to-end railway.Tunnelling Progress -  Now complete. Stations and tunnels fit-out - The focus continues on the handover to system wide contractors and with this work is underway on the tunnel and station fit out works. Rolling Stock - A recovery plan is in place in response to falling behind the schedule for cab manufacture. Full recovery to schedule is forecast for 1 October 2016. Emerging issues arising with installation of signalling software for trains running on Heathrow Spur that could impact commencement of services to Heathrow in May 2018. This has been escalated between TfL and Bombardier senior management with regular reports being provided to DfT. Dates for unit testing at Derby Old Dalby and On Network being held. Key Risks - The cost escalation risk mentioned above can be broken down to the risk that engineering contracts are not in line with Crossrail Ltd forecasts and that escalation of Network Rail costs result in the need for DfT  to provide additional funding. Additional risks include pressures to change the existing scope of the project during the construction phase; suitable agreement is not reached with Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL) on issue of Heathrow Access Regulation; agreement over additional Crossrail services and the impact on other services.,Network Rail is the Government's delivery agent for the East West Rail Programme. Overall - Phase 1 extension of services to Oxford from Oxford Parkway is expected to be completed to the agreed revised target of December 16. Phase 2 Bicester - Bletchley and Aylesbury - Claydon Junction is expected to complete GRIP 3 (single option selection) in December 16 and GRIP 4 (single option development) by December 19 (as per Hendy Review) with completion in CP6 (next funding period from April 2019).  Cost - Phase 1 NR has confirmed a cost escalation of £48.3m (12/13) in excess of budget as a result of delays in obtaining consent from Oxford City Council and additional scope required under planning conditions. NR identified £11.5m of cost savings by de-scoping elements of the EWR programme. Programme Board met on 22 June and approved the £11.5m of savings and recommended that the remaining gap is considered by Portfolio Board. Phase 2 no budget set beyond GRIP 4 (single option development) in CP5. Key Risks - Phase 1: late handover to operator resulting in operator claims. Planning conditions imposed by Oxford City Council including noise mitigation and the number of trains that can operate could impact on programme delivery if not resolved Phase 2: no budget being available for completion - stakeholder aspirations that Phase 2 will be delivered in CP5.  Integration of Depots and rolling stock. HS2 integration (HS2 Grip 3 [single option selection] due July 17). Planning processes such as public inquiry could face challenge and delay programme,Network Rail is the Government's delivery agent for the GWRM Programme. This is a high priority programme which was reviewed as part of the Hendy Review. Current progress for this quarter includes successful Late May Bank holiday works with key highlights such as the complete removal of West Ealing sidings multiple bridges successfully replaced OLE installations by Crossrail and The Greater West programmes and 1.1 miles of Up Main renewed on the Bristol Parkway to Gloucester line.  Additional Late Summer works in Hinksey blockades are planned for 30 July to 15 August which will involve signalling flood alleviation track renewal and bridge replacement works. The next key infrastructure milestone (IEP Test track -RS3) between Reading to Didcot is expected to be met on September 2016. Through better management and improved governance processes the team is making good progress in the programme. However there are still significant overall concerns over the confirmation of required outputs cost escalation and risks to timely delivery of the electrification programme that the team are currently working to mitigate . A snapshot of key works include: EP Test track deliverability £ The Test Track is proceeding well and the mains are currently treated as live.  Overhead Line Electrification is progressing but Network Rail will need more access to tracks and depots between August and September which they will be negotiating with operators.  This is critical for meeting the NR commitment to deliver depot electrification for 30 Sep 2016 and completion of the test track; National SCADA programme (Supervisory control and data acquisition) £ This should have been in place by now however there are issues regarding user acceptance.  A mandraulic solution will be used for the short-term and mitigations are being investigated for the longer-term if acceptance cannot be obtained quickly.  This has the potential to significantly affect the delivery of the Programme and the rolling stock cascade; Steventon Bridge £ Additional work has been commissioned in order to ensure a strong case is submitted to English Heritage in order to gain approval for the removal of Steventon Bridge; Severn Tunnel £ The T-10 review has shown NR are on track for the successful delivery of works during the blockade from 12th September £ 21st October. During the period of distruption rail users will be diverted via Gloucester or use replacement buses; Goring Gap - NR are working up 3-4 options for stakeholders to review followed by a public consultation in September. A solution is anticipated by the end of the year but it is unclear when possession and workforce will be able to retrofit; Christmas 2016 works - There are not enough resources equipment or access to complete the Xmas works fully. NR is considering fallback actions including considering alternative means of delivering the scope or bringing forward sections of the work. We are awaiting confirmation when and/or what works might be rescheduled.,Whilst HS2 is a large and complex programme that is still at a relatively early stage with the Phase 1 hybrid Bill now in the Lords following a positive outcome at Commons 3rd Reading and the Major Works Civils Contracts (MWCC) ITTs issued in early June 2016 successful delivery of the programme appears feasible. As such the current delivery confidence status is AMBER. PHASE 1:The hybrid Bill remains on track for Royal Assent by Dec 2016. 2nd Reading in the Lords took place on 14 April and the Lords Select Committee (appointed during May) heard locus cases from 7 June to 11 July. Petitioner hearings started on 5 July and are expected to continue until end Oct; ITTs for the MWCC were issued on 8 June; RP1 has been concluded with a letter sent from David Prout to Simon Kirby on 1 June to formally complete the process and set out expectations and requirements for the period to RP2. The key challenge for Phase 1 is to increase the schedule delivery confidence from 60% to nearer 80%. HS2 Ltd have been commissioned to address this and will report back in Sept. PHASE 2: Work has started to plan and develop the material to support the Phase 2a hybrid Bill which we aim to lay in Parliament in summer 2017 and we continue to prepare advice for the Secretary of State to inform a decision on the Phase 2b route this autumn; Sir David Higgins published his recommendations on the route through South Yorkshire in July; The Secretary of State agreed to revise the remit to Network Rail for Crewe and clarified the need to find an option that can be delivered for less than £500m. The key challenge for Phase 2 is to ensure the scheme is affordable within the existing SR15 settlement. For Phase 1 and 2 there is also a key challenge around ensuring that Network Rail has the capacity to develop the On Network Works to support the programme and that they are delivered on time.COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS: Integrated Decisions Plan produced bringing together all decisions relating to Rolling Stock & Depots and Future Operations and Classic Rail Interface projects over the next 18 months. WIDER PROGRAMME: The IPA led a Periodic Update to assess HS2 Ltd's efficiency plans - circa £9bn worth of potential saving opportunities identified across the programme. NAO report on the progress of HS2 published on 28 June described HS2 as a large complex and ambitious programme that was facing cost and time pressures. However the report also recognised the cost savings identified that the strategic context and objectives were now more clearly demonstrated than since the previous report and that HS2 was making good progress and was on course to gain the powers needed to start building the railway by the end of the year.,Overall: Train build on schedule. High risk of delayed entry into service due to late delivery of GW test site but mitigations eg early access to the GW test site can help reduce the delay risk. Series of meetings between DfT NR and Agility to resolve. Progress: Train Build: As planned. 37 of the 57 GWR sets under construction; Depots: North Pole complete Stoke Gifford (largely complete subject to modificiations to accept an all bi-mode fleet) Swansea (complete subject to commissioning in September 16) Doncaster (Topping Out planned July 2016); Testing: Certificate for electric testing on ECML received. Diesel tests continue;Network Rail: Programme of gauge enhancements platform works and power upgrades continue; Communications: Launch event for GWR fleet on 30th June 2016; Finance: On budget. Finance options for bi-mode variation will be put to Ministers this Autumn. Top Project Risks 1. GWR and then VTEC trains 100 days late as a result of NR's delayed completion of test track between Reading and Didcot with potential for Liquidated Damages of £200m. Mitigations to reduce delay under assessment during July 2016. GW Change Team kept informed as existing fleet needs to be kept longer. 2.  Industrial relations problems associated with changing work practices. Response lead by TOCs and dormant at present. Kept under review in context of GTR. 3. Train design does not meet specification. Managed through monthly Delivery Review with Agility Trains and Hitachi. DfT's speciliast technical advisors used for assurance that the train meets our requirements. 4. Dependency on GWRM particularly completion of NR test track by end September. Bi-mode variation helps reduce dependency on electrification although operating costs increase.5. North Pole and Doncaster depot capacity - Hitachi may have committed additional trains as a result of other AT300 orders. Depot capacity being assessed by SDG.,"Work is continuing on the Options phase with an approved scope and programme of work. Four front running options one at A and three at C have been identified. In June 2015 these and the rationale for their selection were shared with Highways England Board DfT (BICC & Special Advisors) and with the Roads Minister. A proposed solution was approved by the Highways England Board in October 2015.  Approval to proceed with non-statutory public consultation was obtained from BICC on 18 Jan 2016 and consultation started on 26 Jan 2016.  The SGAR 1 was undertaken in Nov 2015 and the project was rated ""amber"" pending completion of non-critical deliverables at that time.  Funding: £29.7m of options funding has been approved and is sufficient for the remainder of the Options Phase. BICC approved an initial tranche of development phase funding in Feb 2016. A Technical Partner was appointed for the remainder of the project on 6 May 2016.  The Project is in the process of analysing the response to consulation in order to develop a Preferred Route Recommendation.Summary : The project is on track to deliver a preferred route recommendation to DfT during Q4 of 2016.  Risks 1. Insufficient political support  with the result that the project is not considered to be a priority over other investments.  Mitigation - The Project is working with DfT officials to ensure that benefits are well articulated and understood in both DfT and HM Treasury and clearly described in the Outline Business Case.   2.Objectors to the Project may seek a Judicial Review leading to dealys and additional costs.  Mitigation - The Project has consulted with stakeholders during the development and assessment of options and has strictly adhered to a consultation process which has been developed with legal advice and assured by the Consultation Institute (there is a clear audit trail of analysis and decision making). 3. The Preferred Route Annoucement could be delayed pending DfT and HMT agreement regarding financing (public v private).  Mitigation - The Project is supporting DfT in its discussions with HM Treasury and ensuring that both parties are aware of the impact on the cost and delivery schedule.  ",The MML programme does not have an approved business case although the draft economic case previously developed demonstrated a strong BCR.Following the pausing and unpausing of the programme and the Hendy review the economic case and the assumptions on which it is founded now require refresh which will be accomplished in conjunction with external advisors . A draft integrated business case is expected to be available in September 2016 that clearly articulates the value of the benefits that will be realised by the programme.Following the reset of the MML programme a revised programme baseline was approved in June 2016.Other current issues that are being resolved are listed below: MML infrastructure delivery shown as Red in Hendy report. Detailed replanning for electrification elements underway by Network Rail; Works in Leicester area present delivery risk to electric services in 2023 as anticipated duration of track works lead to a late start of electrification works; Line speed improvements at Market Harborough not fully funded. £9m shortfall in funding awaiting approval to fulfil shortfall from PJIF; No robust maintenance solution in place for the electric stock to provide 2019 services. Shared usage of Bedford Caudwell depot provisionally agreed; OLE speed improvement south of Bedford not planned for completion until CP6. Initial electric journey times will be longer than current diesel journey times; Other cost pressures still emerging such as increase in AFC for LDHS platform lengthening works in CP6. Completion of the actions above and resolution of the issues cited are expected to return the programme to Amber-Green status.,Network Rail is the Government's delivery agent for the North of England Programme. Evidence for RAG: Whilst there has been some good progress delivery confidence is amber/red due to complexity of aligning Franchise Service proposals and cost escalation. Progress update/Key Risks and Issues: North of England: The NoE Programme remains challenging; Workshops have been held to align with NR programme with franchise proposals with an improving position for electrification between Manchester and Blackpool; The next key infrastructure milestone in the North of England (Calder Valley West) is on target for delivery for December 2016. Construction is progressing on key elements of programme: including Ordsall Chord (on time for December 2017) and electrification (Manchester to Blackpool in phases for December 2017/May 2018); Some complex issues are outstanding(e.g. power supply); Cost escalation concerns emerging around power supply and new electrification standards; Waiting for a decision on Transport and Works Act Orders: - Manchester Oxford Road Piccadilly and Hope Valley; The delay to the electrification could further impact on the availability of cascaded diesel rolling stock to deliver franchise commitments. Transpennine Route Upgrade: There has been good progress on the Transpennine Route Upgrade as the Client Development Remit was signed on 8 July 2016.  It establishes the basis for Network Rail development work which should report in December 2017.  A full funding application based on this development work is due to be submitted in early spring 2018 to authorise funding beyond April 2019 to completion;£ Emerging concern regarding interaction between Clients ( DfT and Rail North) aspirations for delivery by December 2022 and NR proposed programme. Finance comment: Some of these projects are well advanced in their delivery and some are in development. Taken as a whole the wider programme is expected to be in the region of around £5bn; No certainty on funding beyond March 2019; We are reconciling our budgeted figures with NR  this process remains challenging.,TOP RISKS: Bidder appetite/confidence in market £ challenging position has been exacerbated by Brexit; West Coast limited bidder pool and interdependencies with HS2; Current instability creates challenging environment for seeking timely decisions from HMT and Ministers. East Anglia £ immediate risk over whether can contract with bidder given the changing economic position; KEY EVENTS: West Coast - ICWC to carry out feasibility study to look at the Baseline Max option. EOI date to be pushed back to mid September with the ITT potentially moving back to Jan 17. South Western - detailed planning required to identify opportunities to mitigate delay as timetable now very tight.East Anglia - High immediate risk over ability to contract following referendum. ,The UK SAR Programme is nearing conclusion of the transition phase. Seven new bases are now in operation. The next bases transitioning to the UK SAR-H contract are existing Coastguard bases at Lee-on-Solent and Sumburgh in April 2017 and the final base Stornoway will go live in July 2017. A decision has now been made confirming Lydd as our base in the S.E. A new transition plan has been agreed with BHC to introduce the 11 contractually committed AW189s to UK SAR over the next two years.,The DfT Shared Services Implementation Programme comprises a series of planned (tranche) migrations  to the new ISSC-1 service provision.  Originally scheduled to complete by the end of the 2014 calendar year migration delays have meant a rightward shift of all planned deliveries. The deferment of tranche-2 (DfT & DVLA - scheduled for Nov-2015) resulted in further tripartite discussions  between Cabinet Office (Framework Authority) DfT and arvato on  delivery re-planning options incorporating provision  for OGDs to exit their contracts. Those commercial discussions commenced in November 2015 have resulted in a head of terms agreement with our supplier that is in the final stages of contractualisation. Subject to final agreement DfT family migrations to an Agresso platform will cease whilst work will be undertaken to migrate the entirity of DVSA onto a shared SAP platform. ,Network Rail is the Government's delivery agent for the Wessex Capacity Programme (the infrastructure element of the South West Route Capacity Programme). The contract for rolling stock let and being reported as on time. Infrastructure works are underway launch event was held for the start of works at Waterloo International in March 2016.  Steps have been taken through the programme board and Enhancements Portfolio Board to manage and mitigate some cost escalation (c£90m) reported on this programme in early 2016.  As a result the projected CP5 (2014-2019) cost for the programme has returned to the 2015 Hendy baseline (although the CP6 forecast cost has consequently increased by c.£30M).   The South Western franchise ITT went out on the 30 June 2016 and working closely with the franchise colleagues in monitoring impacts that may rise relating to the infrastructure programme. We are collaboratively working with Network Rail South West Trains and DfT£s Passengers Services with regards to the introduction of the Class 707 rolling stock and the gauging clearance. Site surveys to be completed to determine what works are still required to run the new rolling stock.We are also working closely with Network Rail South West Trains (SWT) and the SWT Alliance on Waterloo station£s capacity works for next year August 2017 (including circa 23 day possession). This includes: a media campaign to be launched in August 2016; and the TDM work-stream which provides DfT the assurance required in delivering the Waterloo station capacity works and managing the possession effectively.,The project is progressing to time with the trains manufactured (by Siemens) works by Network Rail (including rebuilding of London Bridge Station) and the construction of Hornsey depot all being delivered to the programme schedule. A key milestone was achieved in this period with the first Thameslink Class 700 train entering passenger service on 20 June 2016. The operator Govia Thameslink Railway is running trains in a diagrammed service and by summer 2018 all 115 new trains will be introduced onto the expanded Thameslink network. Hornsey Depot is on schedule for completion and handover in July 2016. The Hendy Review identified a requirement to increase the Anticipated Final Cost (AFC) estimate for Network Rail's infrastructure works by £450m. The AFC increase has been approved by the DfT£s Board Investment and Commercial Committee in February 2016. A control agreement has now been arranged with DfT Thameslink Programme team and Network Rail which includes a more robust reporting arrangement and sign-off of costs issues.The £450m will increase the capital value of Thameslink Infrastructure works to c. £5bn. The programme team is closely monitoring the risk to Network Rail Cost Control this is especially important as we approach operational readiness. The main challenges/risks facing the programme are recovery of the rolling stock acceptance and introduction into operation programme the passenger facing changes at London Bridge (Aug-16)  depot facilities in the Cambridge area delivery of 20 trains per hour and 24 train per hour through the core timetable development and train operator resources. These challenges should not prevent completion of the programme in December 2018. ,Cab fitment for passenger first in class (prototype) design is proceeding to plan. Two of the five procurements have been signed with two more on target to be signed later this year and the fifth next year.Agreements with Freight operators and suppliers were planned to be signed by Network Rail and Industry in October this year.  The timing and scope of the freight commercial agreement is being re-examined to ensure it achieves best VfM.Fitment of necessary digital signalling equipment to a test facility (Old Dalby Rail Innovation and Development Centre) is currently being re-tendered by Network Rail as the previous contractor would be unable to fit the equipment to the agreed timeframe.  This is currently the key Risk on the project as other cab-fitment activities require the test facility to be available by Q4 2018.Overall the project is forecast to come in within the Hendy set budget of £133.5m in CP5 (12/13 prices).,The Programme is currently holding a forecasting RAG status of Amber.  The Live Service support desk (SIAM) and end user device and LAN support went live during Nov 2015.  During April & May the programme decided to bring together End User Computing WAN Unified Messaging Platform and Tech Refresh into a super-project entitled NED (Networks Email & Devices).  The purpose of this was to further integrate the projects ensuring a joined up approach to delivery and optimising a good end user experience.  This has impacted some of the timescales for the projects against the original Business Case.  Exception reports are to be submitted in July to re-baseline the project plans.The NED Project has now delivered new desktop / laptop devices has delivered c.1750 desktops to users so far and is currently testing other types of devices.  Deployment of laptops are planned to start in August.  It has also delivered over 2500 user mailboxes.  NED has also completed the replacement of the Capita and Atos legacy WAN services.  Only the legacy Driving Test Centre network now needs to be migrated and this part of the NED Project will be closed and handed over to Live Services to manage in the next quarter.  The Application Development Support & Hosting (ADSH) AWS (Amazon Web Services) Legacy VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) scripting is complete and AWS Legacy environments have been created in Non-Production. This is the over-arching environment into which legacy applications will be deployed. WMS (Workforce Management System) Application deployment scripting is complete and an initial instance has been successfully deployed to Non-Prod. Key Risk: Key supplier delivery of services to support Device image creation and deployment. ,Project is at Investment Decision Business case stage. The proposed framework is recommended as the appropriate vehicle with no financial commitment will be made through award of the contract. Only when task orders are placed through the framework will a financial commitment to spend public money be made. Business case is due to go to HE Investment Decision Council on 12th July 2016. Key risks currently to deliver of this project are: not getting timely approvals from the governance boards the business case will have to be submitted to.    As there is no commited spend and this is a request to procure for a framework and not for a specific project there is no need for a programme director,Scheme under construction. Construction on schedule. Key risks are; a) delay to construction increases costs although this will not affect DfT or public sector funding; b) DfT funding has to be increased if traffic too low such that toll income isn't sufficient; c) HMT doesn't provide extra funding; and d) setting up Chancellor's requirement to provide additional funding to cover free use of the bridge by Halton residents and possibly also to residents in adjacent LA areas adversely affects contracts and requires additional legal orders which delays opening of scheme and increases cost to Government. All but a) above should not materially affect the construction timetable. ,The overall delivery confidence has changed to amber/red because of the uncertain devolution policy - the outcome of the joint Tfl/Dft prospectus and the impact this will have on the scheduled competition is still uncertain. Timescales are tight to achieve the EOI Prospectus and SOBC suite of documents and launch of the public consultation by November 2016. ,The  delivery confidence to Amber Red reflects the impact of the referendum - an already challenging position on bidder appetite/confidence in the market has been exacerbated by Brexit. The impact of the current instability on decision making is also uncertain.,Team has been asked to carry out a feasibility study to look at the Baseline Max option and have put together a PID document outlining the project framework for this. Ministerial approval given for the EOI date to be pushed back to mid September to (allow for the exploration of the Baseline Max option) with the ITT potentially moving back to Jan 17. Current workstreams are being reviewed to ensure that the SOBC EOI and prospectus are all ready if it is decided that we should revert back to the competition as is and not take forward the baseline max option.,The Project Manager£s determination to successfully drive forward the approvals of the Business Case has been impressive and widely appreciated by all.Gateway review team reviewed NRTS2 through a Project Management lens and recommendations have been actioned including recruitment of Project Manager Business Manager and Procurement officers to address the step change in Project Management structures and capacity that  is now required in order to progress through the competitive dialogue with industry the approvals of the Full Business Case contract award and transition to the New Service Provider. The approvals process has taken a considerable amount of time and even though a contract extension is now in place until March 2018 progressing the procurement to prorgamme is critical if HE is to be ready with a New Service Provider to transition from Autumn 2017.  Even with approval granted and procurement started given the scale of the challenge the demanding timescales my assessment of Delivery Confidence would be AMBER.   From here on the pace of delivery will be relentless across the procurement transition and business change.Cabinet Office Minister approved spend control on 22/03/16 a PIN was published and an industry day held on 08/04/16 and OJEU published on 06/05/16. PQQ concensous is due on 18/07/2016 followed by ITPD on 01/08/2016 I have confidence these milestones will be met and programme to contract award in September 2017 will be achieved.,There is emerging doubt about the successful delivery of the scheme.   At the time of completing this form (mid-July) we have received informal advice from Transport for London that the scheme costs have increased by £40m and that TfL is considering options which include asking the new Mayor of London whether he wishes to revoke the previous Mayor's support for the scheme.  Based on a discussion with officials (12th July) the SofS was strongly of the view that DfT must hold TfL to the agreement that they (TfL) pay all cost overruns.  He indicated that if TfL took a London-centric approach to Croxley this must call into question the Mayor's aspirations to take over suburban rail services.  The scheme was formally handed over from Hertfordshire County Council to Transport for London / London Underground Ltd in November 2015 and delivery is currently mandated by directions from the Mayor of London (March and November 2015) which include a 100% pain/gain for TfL on any increase/decrease in the cost of the scheme.  Pending completion of a scope/cost review and completion of procurement (both being undertaken by TfL) construction is due to start in autumn 2016 and complete in 2020.  Officials will be discussing the implications of the cost increase with TfL and other stakeholders.,The scheme is currently in Development Phase. The Development Consent Order (DCO) application was submitted in March 2015. The DCO examination period ended on 3 March 2016 and the Examining Authorities report was submitted to the Secretary of State on 3 June 2016.  A decision from the Secretary of State is due 3 September 2016.  Project delivery is likely once the outcome of the DCO process is known.  We have retained one of the existing designers who carried out the preliminary design during DCO to ensure that knowledge is not lost and to mitigate risks in this area. The main risks to the DCO is Air Quality and whether mitigation is required and the Transport Select Committee's report on All lane running. HE Legal and PTSD were supporting the DCO process in order to mitigate the air quality risk.  The detailed designer and contractor were awarded under the Collaborative Delivery Framework in July 2015 to maintain programme and start works once the decision is made on the DCo submission.  The contractor was asked to re-assess the DCO construction programme and review the benefits of changing this to shorten the construction period and the traffic managment lengths thereby improving the impacts on the travelling public. This work was carried out and programme 2A is considered the best option which shortens the construction period to 50 months and proposes to use a greater number of shorter length and duration traffic management to address customer concerns regarding long lengths of traffic management. A new Scheme Estimate for the Scheme has just been produced (29 June 2016) which has increased the forecast outturn of the scheme to £889.6m (central estimate including Programme Risk) from £714.5m (central estimate including programme risk).  The scheme will need approval for the new scheme estimate through IDC HE Board and BICC (September 2016) until this has been approved all costs in Financial information are based on the £714.5 estimate which hass been approved through BICC. ,MC2 - Project formally prematurely closed (following on from last quarters update); OLCS (including CPMS) - Project has been producing an Exception Report to ensure it has sufficient time and funds available to complete it's minimal viable product and ensure it passes the GDS Beta assessment and the solution can go live in early September.  The CPMS component of OLCS only has to undertake the decommissioning of the TAN interface to Oracle which will be undertaken once OLCS has gone live; Programme formally closed as now only one project (OLCS) remaining.  OLCS has it's own project governance structure which remains fit for purpose.  ,The change in delivery confidence to Amber Red reflects several occurrences since the last quarter:High immediate risk around our ability to contract following outcome of referendum;The timescales for required for risk adjustment has pushed overall schedule back by 2 weeks with impacts on approvals. contractualisation and award;Ministerial approval given to re-time the award announcement to 14 July;Judicial Review appeal outcome successful for Dft but Enfield Council taking to Supreme court. ,Challenges remain to develop an effective Revenue Risk Share Mechanism in time for ITT issue. The project has raised the risk of the potential for insuffiicient bidders. Dependencies with HS2: Ongoing liaison with HSR is close to securing agreement on approach and wording the ITT and FA. A significant change to Euston design or possession strategy pre-award could put the competition at risk. BICC to consider if we should seek a side agreement with HS2 for funding;Maintaining a productive relationship with West Midlands Rail. Ensuring that in the long term we are able to deliver a competition that suits both DfT & WMR,There are two related projects - On-train Wi-Fi and Mobile connectivity on Rail. Both featured within the Single Department Plan. Government has committed to free Wi-Fi on all trains in DfT-controlled frachises. The on-train equipment that provides Wi-Fi is reliant on the availability of the mobile operator£s signal to connect the train to the internet.  The mobile connectivity on rail project addresses this. The team has developed a TOC-led approach to be delivered through obligations in new franchises. The approach was endorsed by Ministers. We are currently developing an OBC which will include an output based specification design to focus enhancements where they will generate a financial return. The key risks are the use of the residual value mechanism in franchise as the investment could take over 10 years to pay back and the reliance on Network Rail to develop a plan for how it will provide access and services for telecoms suppliers working for train operators. ,MOT Phase B delivery progress is on track in terms of spend delivery and quality. Velocity and vendor performance are consistent across all workstreams and are showing a gradual increase. The project is delivering value in the form of working software released to Live multiple times each sprint across application database infrastructure and data quality. Over 130 releases to Live have been made since the legacy MOT1 service was retired in late September 2015. A recent peer review by GDS described MOT Phase B as 'an exemplar of how to run a proper agile project' and 'one of the best agile projects we have seen in flight in government to-date' Project delivery improvement has been supported by the new Agile Governance work (commenced in January 2016). The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of this framework is now in place on MOT delivering improved controls and assurance artefacts around agile process and software delivery including delivery roadmap (replacing legacy waterfall project plans) spend tracker (tracking spend for all vendors across all teams and workstreams sprint by sprint) and release plans covering releases of software to Live. The project continued to make good progress during Quarter 1 2016/17 in delivering further enhancements to the new MOT Testing Service application. Key service improvements included delivering functionality to support the rollout of the MOT Training Education and Skills Support (MTESS) service capabilities to support CPMS robustness and SPMS ( Slot Purchase management system) users and development of limited 2-Factor Authentication for early testing with users. Alongside the delivered application improvements the project has continued to refine its service design process to ensure that new features are based on insights from data and are researched and tested with users before development starts. The team has also made good progress in reducing defects by conducting more in-Sprint testing in the development environments enabling early identification and resolution by developers prior to promotion for release. The Common Payments (CPMS) team delivered the robustness features which will improve the communication between MOT and CPMS reducing the timescales for direct debit delivery.  The CPMS code base used by MOT and OLCS are being merged and tested to deliver a single code base reducing the total cost of ownership. The WebOps team have delivered resiliency capability and infrastructure streamlining is reducing the complexity of the architecture and lowering the cost. The move from SkyScape continues with further decommissioning saving £15k/month in costs a number of data quality changes have been deployed to improve the quality of the data available to the garages including 13k duplicate vehicles de-duped 28k incorrect expiry dates corrected 13k links between DVLA and DVSA data repaired which will ensure that Cherished Transfers of these vehicles will be correctly processed. ,ITT publication approved by Treasury (following intervention of the SoS) and draft shared with bidder (during purdah) now published on 30th June; Detailed planning required to identify opportunities to mitigate delay as timetable now very tight; Potential impact of Brexit on bidder appetite,The project has the ambition to be fast-tracked which is driving all processes. This reduces timescales for Highways England internal governance as well as DfT governance additionally the project is novel and highly contentious with reduced timescales for land acquisition ecological surveys stakeholder consultation (statutory) ground investigations etc; The time required for the preparation of an environmental assessment report (EAR) has been reduced from 9 months to 4 months. These significantly increase the risks of going through the judicial review which will have the implication of project delays in excess of 6 months; In terms of progress public consultation is complete. The designer has been appointed; the contract for the construction contractor was awarded 24th May. A ministerial announcement was made on the 6th July; At the moment we are preparing HE governance documents. The EAR is being prepared for consultation due to start 25th of July; We have an overall budget of £250 million and we are working towards completing the project under this budget.; Key risks and issues are outlined in paragraphs 1 and 2 above.,NR's overarching disposals strategy was endorsed by BICC in March. Since then NR has undertaken extensive and detailed work to assess the  asset classes in Plan A of the strategy - which were estimated to have potential to release £1.8bn of Public Sector Net Borrowing (deficit reducing receipts net of costs and taxes). NR's team have worked tirelessly to review all options and develop Business Cases. Analysis to date illustrates how difficult it will be to structure a transactions in a way that works for the stringent ESA 10 rules governing PSNB while protecting the operational railway and delivering value for money. NR has forecasted it will be very challenginge to score more than £300m PSNB proceeds in CP5; NR's next steps to address this potential shortfall in receipts will include: progressing work on the business cases for assets within Plan A; putting the first batch of SOBCs to its Property Board in July for endorsement. NR's project teams will recommend progressing work with a view to carving out any assets and transactions that can score for PSNB (as well as protecting the railway and delivering value for money); considering options for raising cash (e.g. PSND debt reducing proceeds) where PNSB is not achieveable. A relaxation of the accounting requirements would make it possible to raise proceeds through more flexible deal structures such as leases which would enable them to manage operational interfaces; accelerating work on other potential transactions for station retail assets. At present DFT are supporting NR to scope the scale of proceeds NR could achieve from this option;NR will update BICC 18 July on asset disposals (and enhancements).  NR's Board will be reviewing the overall net position in relation to Hendy OMR and Asset Disposals in September before bringing forward its plans for managing delivery and pressures. NR will return to BICC in autumn (ahead of any fiscal event).

Resources commentary,An Integrated Delivery team (IDT) has been established between the Highways England four contractors in two JVs and two designers as a single design entity; the IDT will be responsible for completing the design of the scheme and for carrying out its construction and commissioning between 2016 and 2020. Highways England has a dual role on the project: as the Client (Core and Support Teams); and as an equal Partner within the IDT itself.These two roles are distinct; Highways England acts as the £client£ function which sits outside the IDT to represent the interests of Highways England and is to be differentiated to the equal Partner within the IDT along with the detailed design consultant and the contractors. The Highways England A14 project team operates as Client function and acts as a gateway for accessing on behalf of the wider project team the various service functions within Highways England and for leading on governance and assurance functions. Resource planning within Highway£s England is constantly ongoing. As well as a core Highways England team resource is being utilised from the Programme Delivery Partner Framework to build internal capability and capacity. Elements of the role of PDP also includes formal and structured learning on-the-job learning and mentoring to support the development of Highways England personnel on the porject. Due to these ongoing activities and the unknown potential for success in recruiting the right resource the project is content to report a 'Amber' against resourcing. ,The 8 remaining posts are being actively recruited and there is a transfer of skill from the remaining contractors working on the scheme to Highways England employees.,Covers ACD resource. Additional resource includes Economists/Analysts (c. 17.5 FTE) Corporate Finance (c. 1.5 FTE) and Legal (c.3.3FTE) Q1 16/17 figures reflect increased ACD headcount of 65.3.

External contractor FTE grades are approximations. Number of vacancies being managed down by active recruitment. Currently 25 live campaigns expected to fill 10 vacant posts (from the 26.5 listed) 6 posts on TRA and 9 posts replacing contractors or where leavers are planned.,The contractor resource has been secured to minimise DfT risks to entry into service of a high profile and high value fleet that delivers significant passenger benefits. 3 posts reflects 3 x FTE sourced from a number of advisors.1x HEO FastStream shared with Crossrail. ,Figures above depict the Project Management & PMO Team there are numerous partners / suppliers totalling over 100 that are working in the project. Highways England is recruiting for permanent project staff to reduce the dependency on consultants interims and contractors.,MML programme has two dedicated G7 and 50% of a G6. Deputy Director divides time between 5 routes and implementation of Bowe recommendations. Programme support is from SEO and HEO grades.One full time interim also working at G7 level whilst handover to permanent G7 completed.,The core team will also require support from DfT colleagues in Economic analysis.The team will rely on call-off (specialist advisors) contractors as and when required for this support.( 1 SEO/G7- under review ) The Comms vacancy has been filled and due to start in August subject to contract.,Figures reflect specifically the people working on a franchise competition or direct award. Differences in figures from the previous report represent Northern and TPE projects closing down and South Eastern and East Mids joinning the count and vacancies being filled. ,There are currently no issues with the number of personnel working on the Programme.  Some vacancies may arise as transition matures and resources move from the Transition Programme to augment the Steady State team.  External consultants not listed above are commissioned on an ad hoc basis to provide advise/guidance on technical or legal matters.,A exercise to revise headcount will shortly be undertaken,Estimated resources is based on part of the roles of 1 x SCS PB1 Programme Director 1 x G6 Principal Programme Client 1 x G7 Integration Manager 1 x G7 Passenger Services Commercial Manager 1 x G7 External; Affairs 1 x HEO Programme Advisor. The G7 Programme Client vacancy is currently out to recruitment.

The recruitment campaign for the SCS1 competition is expected to be launched in the next few weeks. The recruitment for the vacant Grade 7 post is being actively pursued either via a standalone recruitment campaign or through a wider recruitment campaign in Network Services which is commencing shortly.,The project is currently under resourced.  This has been recognised and there is an active recruitment for a Grade 7 and an HEO.  A secondee from Industry is also joining the team shortly at Grade 7 level.,Contractors are used to allow Agency staff to focus on core business activities they provide experience and an skill set specific for delivery that can be accessed quickly and the Agency has flexibility over the duration the resource is employed for. ,In order to realise the efficiencies a dedicated core resource is required to be put in place to promote and embed value chain capability in the business & programmes to fully support the new commerial approach & move pavements provision from a project level to a programme level.,LA promoted scheme so limited DfT involvement. Some further policy and Corporate Finance time will be required over next few years on an intermittent basis. ,,,changes represent 2 G7s and a fastream vacancy being added to the team  the loss of 1 HEO  while the vacancy has been filled with an interim.,All external contractors are of  Management level and therefore I have assumed PB7 equivelent. ,LA  promoted  scheme so DfT has no direct role in managing delivery.  There is only a very limited DfT involvement focused on monitoring progress (equivalent to a very small number of days per year).   ,,All contractor PPM roles have been transferred into the DVSA Change Bureau who are responsible for  resourcing requirements across the Portfolio and that where opportunities arise civil servants replace contingent labour.,,no changes,Currently recruiting a G7 to replace contractor.,All contractor PPM roles have been transferred into the DVSA Change Bureau who are responsible for  resourcing requirements across the Portfolio and that where opportunities arise civil servants replace contingent labour.,,Three vacancies were filled in April and currently working on filling two remaining vacancies.,

Cap Commentary (optional),Other capability includes Project Management Office Health & Safety Stakeholder Communications Lands and Legacy. The client team consists of both Highways England staff and staff sourced through the Programme Delivery Partner or PSF/CDF consultancy. In general the non-Highways England posts are the more senior positions. Recruitment of a Highways England Project Director is critical to success; the executive search is on its third iteration to identify a PD. Salary is showing to be a barrier to attracting the right quality candidate. A recruitment exercise is currently underway and it is hopeful that a successful candidate will be identified and appointed as Highways England PD to the project . A Highways England Project Manager started on the 27 June 2016. Complex Infrastucture Programme are currently working on a workforce plan to recruit and fill key posts  in 2016/17. As recognised by the I&PA review (Attachment 5) the client team capacity capability and collaborative behaviours are key for success. In addition to the current recruitment a workforce review and behaviour plan is being produced.Work force planning is currently underway with the IDT determining both workforce and management requirements in order to deliver the scheme in line with the programme. The current analysis suggests we will have a work force that peaks at c. 2000 and a management team that peaks at 500 which includes the Highways England representatives. These figures are derived from resourcing the construction programme which has been smoothed to make the most efficient utilisation of available resource. We will  also review the impact of these requirements against other projects that will be undertaken within a similar time period.,The project is short of key client capabilities in PMO and Stakeholder Engagement. These skills gaps are currently being augmented in part by skills from the supply chain via the PDP Framework. Key areas of recruitment to address these shortages are ongoing.,"Change Implementation (Comms) staff merged with ""Other"" since last report. Technical covers air quality environmental policy leads. Other covers Policy/Legislation Communications and Strategy.  Industry knowledge includes surface access team.A skills review will be undertaken Q2 2016-17 to ensure resource readiness for next programme phase.",The project is monitored by Jacobs as the Crossrail Project Pepresentatives. They provide construction and project management expertise ongoing assurance and periodic reporting on the progress of delivery. The contract is a tripartite agreement between TfL DFT and Jacobs. The project team also benefit from the assistance of the Crossrail Joint Sponsor team.,As Network Rail is the Government's delivery agent for East West Rail Programme the delivery of the Programme is also dependent on the capability and capacity of Network Rail. The project is run by NR. They provide construction and project management expertise ongoing assurance and periodic reporting on the progress of delivery.  Given the recent successful recruitment (who is due to start on 1st August) and the procurement underway for consultants the future outlook on resourcing has been revised to green. ,Other skills refers to Communications.The ratings reflect the anticipation that resources may be further stretched as the Programme progresses putting strain on the team particularly in areas of technical knowledge.  As Network Rail is the Government's delivery agent for the GWRM the delivery of the Programme is also dependent on the capability and capacity of Network Rail. ,1) Current AMBER RAG rating due to number of vacancies and contractors filling posts for project delivery and commercial skills. 2) Other category includes policy communications economists analysts and corporate/administrative skills.3) Active recruitment commenced to replace PD contractors with permanent staff. Some concern over skills gap in PPM and commercial skills available across civil service to recruit to meet future needs of programme.,Other includes 0.3 PA support 0.5 communications capability/external stakeholder management and 0.25 to cover for legal advisors. Change in Commercial and Finance assumes recruitment of 1 x G7 post. Project is also dependent on delivery of approvals by the ORR.,The Project is in the Options Phase and is recruiting staff for the Development Phase in order to reduce the reliance on external and contracted support.  A strategic 4 year contract  is in place to ensure availability of skilled professionals to meet project needs in the short and medium term. A technical partner has been appointed for the Development and Construction Phases. A significant number of senior external resources have been required over this period to maintain the pace of the project through governance approvals public consultation  procurement of the Technical Partner  and the finance discussions between DfT and Treasury. During this period Highways England has been in the process of recruiting for the Project Director and Project Manager positions.,As Network Rail is the Government's delivery agent for the Midland Mainline Rail Programme the delivery of the Programme is also dependent on the capability and capacity of Network Rail.Recently recruited permanent resources require additional training to further develop Commercial & Contract Management skills.Awaiting start of permanent resource to replace previous interim role for programme communications.We are also taking forward procurement to acquire consultant support for business case and technical analysis.,OTHER= Currently Amber setting due support required from communications advisor external stakeholder management and for specialist advisors.  We have recruited (due to commence in August subject to security clearance procedures) a briefing resource in the near term to support the regular requirement for briefing on programmes in the North: The team has reasonable industry knowledge and project delivery experience; Scope managing any large scale programme reviews/political demands.  The technical and industry areas rely on very specific skill sets that are not widespread.  We plan to rely on external contractors as the need arises through call off contracts to provide this expertise. As Network Rail is the Government's delivery agent for the North of England Programme the delivery of the Programme is also dependent on the capability and capacity of Network Rail.,The programme  does not categorise its resources in this way currently. However for the purpose of this exercise : Specification leads managers advisors and assistance are classed at TechnicalProcurment leads managers advisors and assistance are classed as Industry Knowledge; Project Directors managers and Assistants are classed as Project Delivery; The other is a Fast Stream.The programme continues to seek to atttract technical and comnercial specialists. We have made some headway in ths field. We are currently developing our attraction strategy applying HMT agreed payflex testing executive search and working closely with Cabinet Office and Group Procurement on the commercial capability delivery plan. Changes from last period reflect the normal churn.  Northern and TPE projects closing down and South Eastern and East Mids joinning the count.. Some roles being filled by interims and or permanent staff while other roles have become vacant ,External consultants not listed above are commissioned on an ad hoc basis to provide advise/guidance on technical or legal matters.,Delivery of individual business migrations has been delegated to individual business units to manage via individual project teams.  Overview and corporate control is then maintained via a small central team to coordinate and share best practice between the individual projects and liaise with the supplier (ISSC-1) on key delivery strategies.  The resourcing above reflects the central oversight team.Attempts to fill gaps in current resourcing levels was partially unsuccessful (one individual recruited against three vacancies advertised). Resourcing plans will be reconsidered in the short term with the intention to advertise to fill gaps.,Current rag ratings set as amber to represent resource pressure currently faced on the team. Immediate resource pressure should be addressed when recruitment for the 1 x G7 Programme Client Manager has completed (expected to be in bost July/August 2016). There is additional scope for further resource in communications and technical to support the work leading up to the Auust 2017 blockade in particular.As Network Rail is the Government's delivery agent for the Wessex Capacity Programme the delivery of the Programme is also dependent on the capability and capacity of Network Rail.,"""Other"" refers to team administrator/organiser who is shared resource with Crossrail and IEP programmes.                            Commercial & Contract Management and Project Delivery RAG rating have been amended to Amber to refelct the current vacant posts in the team.",,,,LA promoted scheme so limited DfT involvement.

There is still a need for additional administrative and business management (eo and heo) support as reflected above.,"This programme is being led by NR. The NR team have built a matrix team from existing core business teams and contracted with specialist consultants to develop their option appraisal and build the supporting evidence bases for each asset class. In addition to build cabability and provide strong leadership a new Property (subsidery) company is being established (""PropCo"") which will have 3 N.E.Ds. However NR lack the inherent skills base to delvier Green Book compliant SOBCs and OBCs without extensive support from DFT's corporate finance and policy teams. Therefore to support NR with the development of the business cases and the structuring of Deals DfT has established a core programme team and appointed individual business case leads within Corp Finance (supported by secondees from UKGI). It is the role of the business case leads to review and support the develop of the SOBCs and OBCs. The core programme teams (1XG6 1xHEO) will ensure strong engagement with a policy legal and finance leads from across the Dept and ensure proper governance supports decision making and approvals. The DFT internal structure is built around a matrix/agile programme management model. Policy legal and finance leads support the busienss case leads to interface/review/challenge the wider implications of NR's proposals. The table above shows the resourcing for the DFT compliment. The overall RAG rating for the current position relfects the quality and volume of interactions at present. The ""future"" position assumes a worst case scenario whereby NR are not able to deliver OBCs to sufficient quality as to secure approvals from RIB/BICC/HMT and therefore additional pressure to compensate or engage in the front line work falls onto the team in DFT.

Project Costs Narrative Rdel,There are no RDEL cost for the project,The remaining unprofiled spend is an indicative cost for the maintenance of a new 1.8mile (2.9km) bored tunnel discounted for a 60 year return period. ,Non-government costs are being incurred by scheme promoters. Steel Procurement Narrative: This project is not expected to be publicly funded but the private sector airport developer is likely to spend well in excess of £10m on steel-based products as part of the new terminal infrastructure needed to support a further runway. This assertion is based on benchmarking with the Heathrow Terminal 5 scheme where we understand up to £150m was spent on Corus/TATA supplied steel alone. However construction is unlikely to begin until after 2020. Government will set out the national policy need for the construction of new airport capacity through an Airports NPS and therefore government may seek to influence scheme delivery. The CAA will also have an interest in efficient procurement in its role as economic regulator ensuring the passenger only bears efficiently incurred costs.,18/19 Budget includes provision for £3.5m payment of non-protected GW pensions (which crystallise in 2018). 16/17 17/18 and 19/20 include work for benefits realisation and general consultancy. Spending takes into account reviewed figures from September 2015 Mid-Year Review.,,NOTE: The spend can be broken down into the following EDP entries: W001a W001b W001c W002a W002b W003 W004 W005 W006 W006a W007 W008 W009 W010 W011 W012 CR002 CR007 GWEP DNO Cornwall- Regisnalling. This version includes projects which were not previously included: W003 CR002; The budget lines reflect the Hendy baseline figures for the Network Rail enhancement programme as of June 2016. All figures are in 12/13 prices.Data reflects non grant funded enhancement spend only (i.e. projects funded through the DfT loan agreement). It does not include renewals EU funding grant funding or other funding NR used to contribute towards the programme. Pre 2016/2017 has been calculated by adding CP3& CP4 finalised forceast figures plus Hendy CP5 Y1 and Y2 figures Figures included in remaining un-profiled spend relates to forecasts that are currently unfunded reflecting the funding period methodology adopted in rail. Remaining unprofiled spend related to CP6 Yr 4- 5 and CP7 costs.  Budgeted costs in CP6 (post 2018/2019) have not yet been determined as decisions regarding the unfunded scope items have not yet been finalised and approved. The following entries have not been included  as the spend has not been broken down into individual projects: Costs under the Depots and stabling enhacements fund; Welsh Valley Lines electrification (development costs are being funded by the Department but the Project is being taken forward by the Welsh Government) ,The SR15 settlement set a year by year funding allocation for HS2 as a whole for a period of 5 years (2016/17 to 2020/21). Following the precedent set by Phase One we will capitalise expenditure following second reading of the Bill for Phase 2a and the remainder of Phase Two £ our prudent assumption is that this will be from April 2018 and April 2020 respectively.,Pre 2015/16 RDEL Budget and Forecast figures calculated using figures from Q4 2014/15 GMPP report. RDEL for 2015-16 has been increased by 0.75m to account for work to appraise GW electrification mitigations (comprising SDG Business Case re-work and additional technical consultancy work). Spend profile for 2016 to 2019 smoothed to better reflect introduction of new fleet (previous budget assumed no costs after 2017). £130m bi-mode variation not yet included as funding package to be decided Autumn 2016.,Project is entirely funded by capital DEL staff costs are also capitalised.The project is currently in the Options Phase and whole life project forecasts are dependent upon on the single option which is still to be determined.,Revised programme baseline was approved in June 16. Budget lines reflect the Hendy baseline figures for the Network Rail enhancement programme as of December 2015. The Hendy funding envelope for the infrastructure enhancements have been provided in 'Non-government costs' column as '12/13 prices' but does not include MML contribution fromDepots and Stabling fund [Kettering Stabling £22m]. Assumptions: All of Passenger Journey Inprovement Fund (F007) allocated to MML less £16m in CP5 for non-MML schemes.Note 1: Local Enterprise Partnership and other external funding not included.Note 2: Period 2 updated spend profile now includes costs in CP7.,NR has estimated for the total Anticipated Final Cost for the programme is around £5bn in 12/13 prices which includes £2.5bn as an initial estimate for the delivery of TRU by the end of 2022. External funding figures (e.g. third party contributions renewal contributions maintenance costs additional rolling stock costs) have not been included.  Most of the projects were included in the Rail Investment Strategy (HLOS) which was generally considered to have reached SOBC stage although some projects have been built and some are still being planned.  Work is ongoing to align the programme with the appropriate approvals processes to get to FBC status.  There are  cost escalation concerns emerging around power supply and new electrification standards.  It is anticipated that the cost of the West Coast Power Supply Upgrade will move into this programme in the next reporting period.  Note that funding for the programme after 2019 is not yet committed.  The TRU will be subject to approval of a final business case in early 2018 once a single option has been selected. (DfT cash funded Wigan-Bolton figures  from the main portfolio have been estimated and added in year 16/17 & 17/18 for inclusion),The total reflects the inclusion of £the of East Anglia West Midlands and South Western franchises. No finance information is available yet for new franchise competitions recently started West Coast. Budget values are derived from v15.51 of the rail LTF for EA amended for subsequent CP5 and other changes. Economic factors as most recent OBR projections pre-Brexit vote). Forecast from rail LTF June 2015. The June LTF includes updated profiles for subsidy/premium showing more subsidy/less premium up front in the first 2 years of franchises follwed by significantly less subsidy/more premium later in the franchises.Finance data reported from start of franchise,* Budget costs per FBC as previously reported. Forecast costs based on current view of operations per latest project milestones.* RDEL one-off new costs relate to project team costs at DfT(C) and MCA during procurement and transition phases. RDEL recurring new costs relate to UK SAR-H contractual costs. RDEL recurring old costs relate to Gap SAR contractual costs for 4 bases from July 2013 to June 2017.* Underspends from 2015/2016 onwards are the result of contractual variances (e.g. delay to start of operations at Lydd AW189 contingency plan) and favourable changes to variable costs (e.g. fuel price).* Annual Steady State is fully achieved in 2018/19 when all bases have transitioned to UK SAR-H.,Pre-2015-6 RDEL incorporates 2012-13 Phase-1 divestiture spend data and 2013-14 and 2014-15 migration related costs. RDEL 2015-16 onwards incorporates ISSC-1 PACT/IBM SAP & migration costs.There are no anticipated capital spends as part of the SSI-Programme. However because of further migration delays scope change occurred in December 2015.  Consequently a period of re-evaluation and re-planning has been entered into by DfT and the supplier. Those discussions are likely to change the financial arrangements for the remainder of the contract but at this time the impact is uncertain.,R-DEL costs reflect costs historically reported in the previous South West Rolling Stock BICC report which were included in DfT LTF (current and previous versions) and paid via franchise agreement. The costs for rolling stock are contracted (with all new rolling stock in operation in 2018) and therefore not expected to change significantly. The cost figures for Non-Gov costs are in 12/13 prices and reflect the Network Rail enhancement forecasts for the Wessex Capacity programme. The projects in scope for these costs include Waterloo; Wessex Traction Power Supply Upgrade; Reading Ascot to London Waterloo train lengthening; and CP4 rollover schemes including Route 3 Power sign off Package 7 10 Car South West Suburban Railway Wessex ASDO. All of these are reported in Network Rail's CP5 Enhancement Delivery Plan. The figures do not include funding for Depots & Stabling or any contributions from other funding sources including any EU funding renewals expenditure third party funding or from other funding sources.The budget lines reflect the Hendy baseline figures for the Network Rail enhancement programme as of December 2015. The actual figures include Network Rail Period 2 (May 2016) forecasts. The variance in budget vs actual/forecast reflects the increase of £90m reported in early 2016 some of which has been through change control. A remaining change control is due to to go through the joint Network Rail and DfT governance returning this forecast back to the base and should be reflected in the next update. We expect the SRO finance confidence to return to 'Green' in the next update (Q2). ,THLK programme team will conduct a review of the RDEL and Calculated Net Present Costs (rolling stock element) figures and report in the next quarter. Resource costs are mainly related to Direct Thameslink Programme Team costs within DfT plus incentive payments to Network Rail (commercial sensitive) and GTR related to programme delivery milestones. 2016/17 - 2017/18 budget increase reflects costs for Cannon Street ticketing arrangement. The £450m infrastructure cost increase has been approved by BICC and has been added to the Non-Gov costs. The programme team will review the figures and provide the Project Cost to Closure for the Q2 returns.,see CDEL cost narrative. Unable to complete here.,As per Full Business Case version 3.0. The RDEL expenditure covers the project costs expensed to the I&E which covers items such as exit costs and project initiation costs.,,Cost include Crossings Board costs resource provided by DfT to Halton BC to fund the repayment of the construction costs plus funding to cover free use by Halton residents.,Budget values are derived from v15.51 of the rail long term forecast. Forecast from Dec 15 rail LTF. These forecast figures are based on the latest 'shadow bid' model our technical advisor's view of likely bid outcomes. We are not yet in a position to share any financial information provided by the current bidders as the evaluation is ongoing. There remains the inherent risk that the actual winning bidder's figures will differ materially from those forecast in the shadow bid.,,Financial data for this project cannot yet be determined as the franchise length and content has not been decided. . This is expected when the SOBC has been approved. ,These costs are based on the costs from the OBC submitted to BICC on 05/10/15 and approved by CO spend control.,Includes DfT grant of £29m paid as RDEL comprising £24m in 2014/15 to Herts CC and £5m to Greater London Authority in 2015/16.  Herts CC incurred c.£2m of RDEL from its own budget.,Project is entirely funded by capital DEL staff costs are also capitalised.,These figures cover the running costs of OLCS (including CPMS),The forecast is drawn from the June 2015 LTF which has been updated in line with the 'lead bidder' position for East Anglia. This indicates lower premia in the first 2 years followed by higher premia thereafter.,We have issued the ITT for WM and so are in a position to provide our first view of the potential subsidy across the franchise.,Budget was allocated in Spending Review. We are developing a franchise led approach so will not necessarily require this budget. We are developing proposals regarding the use of some of the budget for a Network Rail pilot and considering other uses that will derisk the franchise process and will present these proposals in the outline business case.,RDEL represents the ongoing cost of running the MOT system for hosting licences business service desk and continuous improvement,We have issued the ITT for SWT and so are in a position to provide our first view of the potential premia across the franchise,,There are no projected costs for DFT / HMG at this stage. As any costs associated with disposal will be identified post-OBC when a preferred options is arrived at (circa October/November). 
Project Costs Narrative Cdel,The latest range estimate for the scheme is £1.193bn to £1.662bn with a most likely value of £1.435bn. Spending Round SR13 confirmed a budget of £1.5 billion for the A14 scheme. Currently the scheme has full funidng approval of £1435m. Spend to date is circa £78m. A contribution of £100m has been committed by Local Authorities and the LEP and contingent on a start of works by Dec 2016. Heads of terms have been agreed with all parties and final legal agreements are to be signed before main construction works commence on site. The project remains on track to meet the public commitments and those set out in the Delivery Plan namely to: start construction Dec 2016 and open the new route to traffic by December 2020.The forecast profile is based on the latest approved Highways England estimate of £1.435bn which was developed in April 16. A firmer cost estimate recognizing any further efficiencies will be signed off at the point of Notice to Proceed.,The budget is based on the Highways England approved capital baseline (version 1.1).  The AMBER status is because the current funding in RIS1 is unlikely to be sufficient to progress the project to start of works by the end of the RIS1 period (budget = £39.6m forecast = £67.76). This is being resolved within the overall Highways England programme picking up budgets for work that supports Trans Pennine Tunnel and review of development phase and construction costs within RIS1. However the latest overall scheme cost estimate for the working assumption (2.9km tunnel) in September 2015 indicates that the  most likely outturn cost is circa £1275.7M (P50 without programme risk) £1366.4m (P50 with programme risk) against an approved scheme budget of £1380.8m (without programme risk). The current approved funding for the options phase is £21.0m (comprising £17.5m with £3.5m contingency).,No costs are stated under CDEL as a decision on preferred scheme has not been taken and therefore full programme cost is not clear at present. The current expectation is that the scheme will be funded by the private sector.The Airports Commission assessed costs attributed to the different expansion options. The Programme have reviewed these costs and revised them for consistency with other areas of appraisal. The scheme and surface access costs for the carbon-traded assessment of need scenario (£bn 2014 prices Present Value) read as follows: LGW2R LHRENR LHRNWR Scheme and Surface Access Costs -6.0 -14.1  -16.1 Note: Work is ongoing to finalise surface access requirements and costs and the allocation of costs between scheme promoter and Government. Budget related to surface access will sit in road and rail.,These figures reflect the project to construct the Crossrail railway only and exclude the contract to deliver the rolling stock and depots.It is important to note that the budgeted figures provided above reflect when TfL and DfT make contractualised contributions into the Crossrail Ltd account. It is assumed that the budgeted figures reflect when the investment is made. The forecast figures provided are taken from the Crossrail Investment Model (May 2016 with the next one available in November 2016) and reflect when Crossrail Ltd actually incurs expenditure at P95 confidence levels. Therefore the budget and forecast figures will not match.Forecast costs have risen since the last quarter due to (i) the culmination of discussions between contractors and Crossrail Ltd in closing out contracts; and (ii) falling interest rates. However Crossrail Ltd continues to take steps to prevent further increases in forecasts and the Project Representative is closely monitoring Crossrail Ltd£s performance to provide the Department with ongoing assurance.Government CDEL also includes On Network Works figures (incurred by Network Rail) the cost of which was defined in 2011 at Review Point 4 (the point at which both Sponsors reviewed their contributions to the project). The £200m income in 2016/17 is a City of London contribution which will be paid to DfT on completion of a number of project milestones. This is currently forecast for 2016/17 but there is a risk this could slip in to 2017/18. The £70m income in 17/18 is a contribution from Heathrow Airport Ltd which will be paid to DfT once milestones relating to the Crossrail services to Heathrow are completed. The two £25m payment in 18/19 and 19/20 are further City of London contributions linked to the commencement of services through the central section in 18/19 and to Reading in 19/20.,June 16 cash prices - inc. Phase 1 & 2. Phase 2 is budgeted for completion of GRIP 3 and 4 in CP5. The Hendy report states the delivery of Phase 2 will be started 'as soon as possible' and a decision will be taken on this by DfT and NR when the GRIP 3 costs are known in December 2016. Figures included in the 2019/20 and un-profiled spend relates to forecasts that are currently unfunded reflecting the funding period methodology adopted in rail. Depots & Stabling / EWR Consortium's £45m contribution not included. NOTE: NR have reported a £44m cost pressure for Phase 1 (£52m including £8m from overestimating Chiltern's contribution in Hendy) . Options to fund this were considered by Programme Board in June 2016 with a total of £11.5m of de-scoping options approved. The remaining cost pressure will be considered by the next Portfolio Board.,,The 15/16 budget is a product of revised corporate planning round. In the 2015 Spending Review (SR15) Government restated the long-term funding envelope for the HS2 programme at £55.7bn in 2015 prices. This budget is for delivery of the full HS2 scheme including rolling stock. The SR15 settlement set a year by year funding allocation for HS2 for a period of 5 years (2016/17 to 2020/21) including an allowance for inflation.In summary the total funding envelope of £55.7bn (in 2015 prices) is in Real Terms whereas in comparison the funding allocated for years 16/17 to 20/21 is in Nominal terms.For the purposes of this spreadsheet only WLC refers to the total funding envelope of the HS2 programme.  Total C-DEL spend (D74 and D75) is reflective of report period only (2015/16 - 2019/20).WLC Table below is based upon the latest assumption of capitalisation for the HS2 project.The splits provided for phase 2a and 2b are indicative and should not be taken as the basis for future ring-fencing (to be agreed with HMT as part of the SR15 settlement). Program costs are reported only at the whole programme level. ,The total costs of £5.7bn are financed via PFI payments over 27.5 years. DfT guarantees use of the trains in the Great Western and East Coast franchises. Network Rail funded in CP5 to deliver £480m of enabling works prior to entry into service. Network Rail funded in CP5 to deliver £480m (classified as C-AME not CDEL which is why it is included in non government costs) of enabling works prior to entry into service.,The overall forecast for the RIS1 period is indicative at this stage as the costs will depend on the conclusion of the options phase work and the agreed timetable for progressing the scheme. A more detailed estimate for the development phase is being established and will be presented to DfT in Autumn 2016 after approval of the OBC and the Preferred Route Announcement. Forecast presented relates to Options and Development Spend Only. The budget in RIS1 (2015-2020) is based on the Highways England approved capital baseline (v1.1); aginst this the forecast shows considerable variance. A more detailed estimate of costs in the RIS1 period is being developed before seeking HE DfT and HMT approval. Once that work is done it will enable a more accurate variance to available funds to be understood., ,,THERE IS NO C-DEL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROGRAMME.,* Nil CDEL costs per FBC as previously reported; * No account has been taken of the potential impact on CDEL of the application of new lease accounting rules in IFRS16 (published in mid-January 2016) which are due to come into force for corporate entities in FY 2019/2020. DfT(C) has been notified of the potential CDEL exposure for the departmental risk register. * Guidance on lease accounting for the public sector is awaited from HM Treasury.,There are no anticipated capital spends as part of the SSI-Programme. However because of further migration delays scope change occurred in December 2015.  As a consequence a period of re-evaluation and re-planning has been entered into by DfT and the supplier (arvato).,,THLK Programme Team to conduct a review of the CDEL figures for the next quarter and populate figures up to 2019/2020 etc. CAME/CDEL above represents direct costs to the DfT budgets. Other capital costs are incurred by Network Rail (Infrastructure) and Siemens (new trains and depots). NR cost forecasts have increased by c. £450m in relation to infrastructure costs which were included in the Hendy Review.  The NR cost increase has been approved by the DfT with a review of the protocol arrangements with NR. The total programme Whole Life Cost has increased to £7bn (c. £5bn is NR infrastructure costs £1.6bn for Rolling Stock and £0.3bn for depots). *This number has not been included in the capital costs table above as the programme team are conducting a review of the CDEL figures which will be availbale in the next quarter. ,At the time the Hendy funding envelope was set to 133.5 million pounds for the ETCS cab fitment fund the scope had not been fully defined to match the new budget and so budget was spread evenly amongst the 3 remaining years of CP5.  The forecast figures based on the new scope and budget of the fund show less spend in 16/17 and 17/18 with greater spend in 18/19.Fitment of passenger train fleets will be funded and reported through franchising.CP6 spend has been left at 0 in the above table as no agreements have yet been made on how any CP6 budget will be spent.  The Hendy Review reduced the cab fitment fund in CP5 form £194m to £133.5 sugegsting the remaining £60.5m be rolled into CP6.,The capital costs (one off) represent the project costs for staffing plus the transition costs.CDEL recurring costs represent the annual replacement budget for capital items.,Annual project costs are based on the pavement spend in the programme for capital projects in RIS1 years 2 3 & 4 & RIS2 year 1 plus a 5% contingency. SRO confidence is green as we are procuring for a framework and as such there is no commited spend.  2020/21 is beyond this current RIS period for which we are requesting the framework for and is an estimate of the potential spend.  ,Costs include all capital costs from both DfT and Halton BC which cover payments to cover the scheme's land remediation and purchase as well as other capital expenditure. ,THERE IS NO C-DEL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT.,,,See note above,Includes an additional £40m based on informal (at the time of writing) intelligence from TfL that the scheme costs have increased by circa £40m.  We are currently investigating this with TfL.  We do not know the profile of this cost increase so the £40m has been added to the final year (19/20).,£714.5 based on estimate approved in 2013. This will be updated to reflect the new Scheme estimate once it has been approved by BICC (expected September 2016).,OLCS is due to go live in September 2016; The total Actual/Forecast has increased since last quarter by £2.3m due to extended timescales for OLCS this is using their Optimism Bias (£1.6m) and an additional £0.7m overrun to allow the project to pass the GDS assessment and go live on gov.uk in September 2016.,THERE IS NO C-DEL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT.,,Budget was allocated in Spending Review. We are developing a franchise led approach so will not necessarily require this budget. We are developing proposals regarding the use of some of the budget for a Network Rail pilot and considering other uses that will derisk the franchise process and will present these proposals in the outline business case.,CDEL represents the capital cost of software build and deployment including the Phase A stage which enabled the switchover from the legacy system. Phase B which was approved in the exception reportwhich builds on the functionality of Phase A and re-architects key components of the service to mitigate technical debt.These costs exclude the optimism bias.,,Forecast based on the Order of Magnitude estimate for the preferred site option as announced by the Secretary of State to construct the lorry park at the Stanford West site. (NB The estimate for the alternative option at Junction 11 produced a total cost of £213.7m with a similar annual forecast profile.) The budget figures incorporated in the above table are consistent with the announced and expected pattern of funding being declared available by the Department for Transport., There are no projected costs for DFT / HMG at this stage. As any capital costs associated with disposal will be identified post-OBC when a preferred options is arrived at.

Benefits Narrative,A benefits plan and efficiency register are live documents to enable the capturing of efficiencies and benefits in accordance with ORR requirements. As part of the governance process the A14 requested a new Value for Money Statement which was provided by DfT Roads Economics and Modelling in May 2016 and included in governance papers.This gave a adjusted Present Value Benefits (PVB) of £2398m (consisting of PVB of £1266m journey time reliabilty of £953m and wider economic benefits of £179m) against a Present Value Costs (PVC) of £928.5m; giving Medium - High value for money. ,Notes: present value benefits (adjusted) for a 2.9km twin bored tunnel are £545m; traditional present value costs for a 2.9km twin bored tunnel  £1031m. This scheme has significant non-cashable benefits relocated to the World Heritage Site that surrounds Stonehenge recognised in the DfT Roads Economics' Value for Money Statement 13 January 2016 that supported the Options Phase budget approval. The scheme is in options phase and a SOBC is being prepared for approval in July. This will consider traditional benefits using WebTAG methodology and in addition wider economic benefits to the South West region and heritage benefits to World Heritage Site.,The Airports Commission Final Report calculated benefits and disbenefits for the three schemes. Following Departmental review the figures have been updated in line with further work undertaken and the figures below are set out in the Programme's Further Review and Sensitivity Report:  LGW2R  LHRENR   LHRNWR Passenger Benefits / Government Revenue / Wider Economic Impacts 48.5 / 2.5 / 8.1     46.9 / 1.5 / 10.0    55.4 / 1.8 / 11.5 Total benefits  59.1                     58.4                      68.7 Environmental Impacts / Producer Profit Loss (Net of reduced delays)        -1.5 / -40.8          -2.8 / -31.2            -2.7 / -38.0                                             Net total benefits before costs                                                               16.8                     24.4                      28.0 Net present value of Benefits £billion 2014 prices carbon traded assessment of need scenario,We have sought to profile the benefits by year as different stages ofthe project open but at this time that information is not available. We are working with TfL to identify this data and hope tohave it in place by the time of the Q2 return. This data is from July 2011 Crossrail business case. Single figure given to represent Net Present Benefits (including monetised non-cash benefits) over 60 year appraisal period discounted to 2002 values. Operating revenues excluded - aligned to WebTAG these are treated as 'negative costs'. To note 'wider economic benefits' are included. The figure of £19.8bn has been taken from the latest business case (2011). The difference between £11bn and £19.8bn reflects wider economic benefits of £8.8bn (2002 prices). BICC/GMPP reporting guidance from the BICC team notes that £Indirect Tax Revenues£ should be categorised as Government-Cashable benefits.There are limited negative benefits for Indirect Tax Revenues now shown separately due to updated guidance. Indirect tax revenues will be foregone as a result of less fuel paid as passengers switch from road to rail and less VAT associated with expenditure foregone to pay rail fares. These impacts are treated as negative benefits to Government as set out in WebTAG. ,The programme has benefits to DfT franchise values and wider economic benefits. New rail linkages jobs and housing.    Enables the introduction of direct rail passenger services between Oxford and Milton Keynes/Bedford and between London (Marylebone) and Milton Keynes (via Aylesbury). Facilitates new passenger and freight rail markets by creating a direct link between the main radial routes from London to the west and north. A key part of this was the construction of infrastructure to enable new services between London High Wycombe and Oxford Parkway extending to Oxford in December 2016. This programme will create economically-vital new transport infrastructure to support Oxford to Cambridge Arc growth delivering faster journey times and providing new rail-based transport capacity.£Facilitates intercity journey time reductions SE to NW and strategic freight growth. The National Infrastructure Commission was appointed in March 2016 to look at economic growth opportunities along the Oxford to Cambridge Arc. Part of this report (due Autumn Statement 2017) will investigate the transport infrastructure (including East West Rail).,The integrated business case  includes a sensitivity testinghighlighting that if total capital costs increased by 50% the BCR would fall to 1.5. The BCR of 2.4 is currently estimated to be too high. Work is currently being undertaken to procure technical consultants to assist in re-freshing the GWRM business case. We anticipate the business case will be completed within the next 6 months. The Great Western Second Direct Award is in effect the initial procurement strategy for delivery of most of the benefits of the GWRM programme itself and represents an affordable commercially sound and sustainable way of providing the Great Western franchised services from the target implementation date of 20 September 2015 until 31 March 2019. A cost benefit analysis was undertaken in the GW Integrated Full Business Case.  NPV of 3000 (2010 £m) has been quoted above in the Cost section and a PVB baseline of 5100 (2010 £M) has been quoted as the 'Remaining Unprofiled benefits to the project' as the Business case document does not detail the benefits by years so we are unable to report this information here.  Please note that due to the Hendy replan this analysis has since been superseded by ongoing discussions with NR/GWR and modifications to the DA terms. Therefore this data has been included for reference. The new analysis has not yet been approved but there is the intention to update the business case when the Hendy baseline has been confirmed. The current intgrated business case also outlines the following NPV values which can be linked back to some of the monetised stategic outcomes under the Summary tab: Benefits - Journey time : 3400 (2010 £m); Benefits - Crowding : 510 (2010 £m); Benefits - Quality : 150 (2010 £m); Benefits - Non -user: 2000 (2010 £m) GWRM does not have resource spend but there is an interface with the IEP purchase of rolling stock,"Benefits (and costs) are appraised over a 67-year period for the full network from 2026 (the opening of Phase One) to 2093 (60 years after the opening of the full Y network in 2033). The HS2 benefits published are not profiled by year. Therefore the totals over the whole appraisal period are listed under the ""remaining profiled benefits to the project"" line. Projected revenues are listed under the Gov.Cashable benefit. The revenue benefits are based on the assumption that all train operations on HS2 will return their operating surplus to the taxpayer via some mechanism for instance franchise premiums. This is a modelling assumption; the specific approach taken on the train operator commercial model will be dependent on future policy decisions.  Benefits included as Wider Economic benefits are listed under Economic (Inc. private partner). Figures from 2015 Phase 2a Economic Case (all figures 2011 Present Value and Prices). Full Y Network: Business Transport User Benefits £43.2bn Other Transport User Benefits £18.2n Other Quantifiable Benefits £0.2bn Loss of Indirect Taxes -£3bn Wider Economic Impacts £14.2bn Total monetised benefits £72.8bn. The reference case BCR is 2.2 including WEI£s and 1.8 without (this includes higher construction cost inflation to 2020).  ",Business Case (2012/14) benefits include improved passenger quality reduced travel times more capacity and environmental benefits.  Total benefits are £3.494bn split East Coast (1.506bn) and Western (£1.988bn). Benefits are spread across 30 years. We are looking at a number of mitigation measures to ensure that the GW fleet can enter passenger service on time in the light of delays to GW electrification. The GW Integrated Business Case (2015) will be further updated to reflect any fleet changes and the impact of the CP5 enhancements review. Business cases all 2009 prices.  There are limited negative benefits for Indirect Tax Revenues now shown separately due to updated guidance. Indirect tax revenues will be foregone as a result of less fuel paid as passengers switch from road to rail and less VAT associated with expenditure foregone to pay rail fares. These impacts are treated as negative benefits to Government as set out in WebTAG. ,The Project is currently in Options Phase the principal purpose of which is to assess the benefits of the potential alternatives and to decide on a preferred solution.  In the SOBC submitted on 23/12/15 the VfM was assessed as High (refer to SOBC and the BICC consideration of 18 January 2016). The economic benefits of £5.55bn (in 2010 present value terms)  is equivalent to the quantified benefits in accordance with WebTAG a combination of the direct and wider economic benefits (primarily agglomeration benefits). The BCR of 2.3 is equivalent to the Initial BCR the Adjusted BCR is estimated to be 3.4.  Benefits Map - No / Benefits Analysed - Yes / Benefits Realisation Plan - No  The Benefits Realisation Plan and Benefits Map will be prepared during the Development Phase in line with Highways England's best practice. Benefits have been quantified and presented in the Economic Case in the SOBC. ,Monetised benefits were originally identified in the draft economic case (Nov 14) but since the pausing and unpausing of electrification and reset of the programme the programme timescales and key assumptions have changed. Electric services on the MML were originally planned to be introduced from 2020 (assumed by Nov 14 economic case) but are now planned to be introduced partly in 2019 and fully by 2023. A draft integrated business case for the programme is being developed that will align with the East Midlands franchise SOBC. The draft integrated business case is expected to be available by September 16 and will be submitted for approval by BICC in October 16. This will confirm the monetised benefits and BCR.,Work is underway to finalise the Benefit  Cost Ratio estimate that combines the three programmes.  The appraisal is over 30-60 years.  A process is in place to develop the IAAP and determine how best to measure the expected benefits in a shorter time frame and in a way that avoids double counting with franchise benefits.  Work is underway to align the benefits measurement with the quantification of benefits as expressed in the economic case for the programme as a whole. The rolling programe of franchise service changes which deliver the benefits have not yet been contracted and will need to be aligned to the NR programme.  Electrification Phase 1 (to Manchester Airport)  and Phase 2  between Liverpool and Manchester/Wigan has already been delivered and  passenger uplift/revenue uplift since delivery could be measured although allocation of this specifically to electrification may be difficult to parse. ,benefits are calcualated on an individual basis and not as a programme,* Calculation of Govt Cashable benefits is based on the difference between the financial cost of the DfT-procured UK SAR-H contract and the equivalent cost of the failed MoD-led SAR-H PFI contract that UK SAR-H superseded. Calculated in nominal terms.* Economic benefits are based on the nominal value of prevented fatalities on the asumption that 25% of all persons rescued or asisted by UK SAR H helicopters would have died - this is within the range of assumptions set out in the Economic Case of the FBC * Benefits Cost Ratio is calculated in NPV terms. This is not represented in the FBC but is calculated from UK SAR-H financial reporting.,Measurable monetarised benefits will result following the successful migration of the DfT family of business units now scheduled for mid-late 2017. The financial benefits have been calculated by taking the costs of services if the Shared Services Centre remained in DfT ownership and cost of core service under the divestment case (F/C) and comparing the difference. There are a number of benefits which have not been monetised in the business case including avoided costs for example MCA would need to spend c£6m to upgrade its IT system if it did not migrate to ISSC1. Soft benefits have not been monetised. The remainder is the aggregate costs over the remaining 5 years. Framework Authority commercial discussion may impact overall benefits but the detail remains sketchy ast this time. Consequently the profile reflected above is subject to change.,Consultancy support is currently being procured to undertake an update to the business case following the Hendy review. The BCR reflects the 2014 business case for the rolling stock procurement which although had a low BCR had a very strong strategic case.,The team willl review the Disbenefits for UK Economic figures and provide an update  for the Q2 returns. The Thameslink Programme Business Case is being updated for approval in October 2016 and will take into account the latest economic forecast/cost changes etc. The number above represents the overall benefits of the programme. We do not have a year by year breakdown but this will be derived during the business case update that is underway. This is drawn from the Business Case Sensitivity Tests Version 1.0 15 March 2013. All figures are presented in 2010 prices/values. The benefits already delivered by the Thameslink Programme include lengthening of platforms on the Midland Main Line to accommodate 12 car trains and improvements to Blackfriars and Farringdon stations. There are limited negative benefits for Indirect Tax Revenues now shown separately due to updated guidance. Indirect tax revenues will be foregone as a result of less fuel paid as passengers switch from road to rail and less VAT associated with expenditure foregone to pay rail fares. These impacts are treated as negative benefits to Government as set out in WebTAG. ,The enhancements covered in this report constitute enabling work for later deployments of Digital Signalling technology.  It is these deployments that would deliver the benefits and business case will be developed for  a future deployment on a route. BICC have endorsed this approach and an outline business case will be submitted in Q4 2016/17. ,The benefits represent the lower running costs of the new sourcing contracts compared to the legacy costs,There is no commited spend as this is a request for a framework. Only when task orders are placed through the framework will a financial commitment to spend public money be made. Highways England has committed to making capital efficiency savings of £1.2bn by 2020. Pavement renewal efficiencies are expected to contribute circa* £350m towards the overall efficiency target for Roads Period 1.  The new Framework is a key enabler to realising this performance.,Benefits year above is the base year benefits are calculated from. VfM is very high and BCR is 7.8.,,,,Figures represent benefits delivered by schemes that are enabled by NRTS. 2010 prices discounted to 2010.,"Benefits year is the ""base year"" benefits are calculated from.  Scheme benefits will be evaluated post-constructon as part of the local major schemes evaluation framework. Under a range of  plausible assumptions a further £25m to £125m of benefits not captured by the standard transport appraisal may be realised by the project.  It would appear that such benefits are sufficiently large to suggest the appropriate value for money categorisation of this scheme is at least £low£ rather than poor as suggested by the BCR.  ",The value of benefits is £602m plus the impact of the scheme on reliability of journey times for business users and transport providers (£338m) and commuting and other users (£312m).  The value of costs is £545m.  These are calculated at 2010 costs. The economic assessment uses the Highways England cost estimate from August 2013. Benefits accuring to road users if off peak periods are not monetised resulting in slight under estimate of the benefits. The appraisal is based on 60 years but traffic levels are assumed constant after 2037.  The BCR reported and the cost is based on the £714.5 approved at BICC in 2013.  This will be updated to reflect the new Scheme estimate once it has been approved by BICC (expected September 2016). ,Cashable benefits are in fact a dis benefit due to the increased running costs of the new system for OLCS,DfT's categorisation of benefits does not currently lend itself to GMPP's structure therefore we have provided the total monetised benefits figure as a work-around.  Please note £201.8m relates to the total Present Value of Benefits at 2010 prices for the duration of the franchise. The figure is shown in the year the franchise starts. ,We compare against a do minimum and no baseline is estimated.  All forecast benefits are estimated as increments to the baseline. Benefits figures are based on OBC uploaded on 20th June. Government cashable benefits recorded here relate to indirect tax revenues foregone. Benefits are calculated over an appraisal period of 10 years from 2017/18., Based on the  primary research undertaken in Autumn 2015 we have estimated there could be an uplift in fare revenue of up to 2% where improvements are made in mobile connectivity.   This varies depending on the degree of improvement in both capacity and coverage that can be achieved where the greatest benefits are found from an uplift from poor to medium internet access.,The new system in its first year of operation. The financial benefits will depend on the actual operating costs of the new system however currently these are forecast to be on budget. ,We compare against a do minimum and no baseline is estimated.  All forecast benefits are estimated as increments to the baseline. Benefits figures are based on OBC dated 27/04/16. Government cashable benefits recorded here relate to indirect tax revenues foregone. Benefits are calculated over an appraisal period of 7 years from 2017/18.,Not available at this stage,"Until we get to the OBC stage (late 2016) and have a set of preferred disposal models performance against the ""benefits"" can't be accurately determined. We are however working closely with NR to develop ""critical success criteria"" against which we can develop detailed VFM modelling/analysis and evaluation criteria. Benefits are likely to include; PSNB cashable receipts; land for housing; passenger outcomes; industry capacity; and efficiencies. "

SRO assurance confidence commentary,,,Assurance Planning signed off by ACPB in February 2016. Activities include a PAR review GARAC review and assurance from DfT bodies and subject experts outside of the Programme; Actions resulting from the MPA Gate 0 review are complete or in progress; Actions around skills and resource planning were undertaken in late 2015 and again in early 2016 but will be a continuing action throughout the life of the Programme.,,,The Programme is undergoing review by the NAO leading to a PAC in the Autumn.  This will provide close scrutiny of the Programme.  After discussion with the IPA a Gate 0 will be deferred until 2017 to avoid duplication.  Separately Network Rail is performing its own Gateway-style reviews on Programmes in the Enhancements portfolio and the results will be shared.  All actions and recommendations received from any assurance reviews and approvals bodies will be tracked and progress monitored with regular reporting to the SRO.  A GIAA Review was carried out in April 2015 which made a number of recommendations.  Since then a new governance structure has been established between DfT and NR which allows greater joint assurance of the programme and the structure of Programme and Portfolio boards enables the SRO to monitor progress carefully.  The Hendy review examined the work contained in the Programme and has re-baselined and redefined the scope.  An IAAP is currently being produced which will set out the assurance and approvals framework for the programme.  ,0,,,,,No,,,,No,,,,,,,The project is subject to monthly assurance in the shape of the PMO Programme Delivery Group (PDG) as well as an agreed Gate 2 pre ITT and the Franchising Programme (of which this project is a constituent part) undergoes an annual Gate 0. ,,,,,,The project is subject to monthly assurance in the shape of the PMO Programme delivery Group (PDG) as well as an agreed Gate 2 pre ITT and the Franchising Programme (of which this project is a constituent part) undergoes an annual Gate 0. ,Internal - Green: currently recruiting a G7 to replace the contractor.

SRO assurance scope RAG commentary,,,A PAR review took place in June 2016 focusing on NPS and Consultation readiness. Rating: Amber; Programme continues to work with the Project Delivery CoE and the IPA on approprate assurance to be undertaken to support delivery. Green Amber rating reflects the early stage of the programme.,,,The Programme has identified appropriate assurance and approvals.  The new joint governance procedure between the DfT and NR allows for closer working on assurance and approvals.  The Hendy Review has established a new baseline for the programme and this is now used to monitor the Programme.  Planned assurance activities over the next two years include the current NAO / PAC Review with a Gate 0 in 2017.  Close scrutiny by Programme and Portfolio boards will lead to a tight control on approvals and a monitoring that the appropriate approvals work is being carried out. ,,,,,,Yes ,,Appropriate monitoring mechanisms are in place to assure the quality of migration deliveries and provide early warning of issues and risks supplemented by a number of independent reviews to validate arrangements. Despite these controls the history of difficulties delays and the hiatus following tranche-2 migration deferral has resulted in further re-planning and option analysis mean that presently the RAG status is AMBER-RED. On-going re-planning and commercial discussions will incorporate lessons learned from previous review assessments and consideration of a tightening of controls and even more regular monitoring of progress arrangements to ensure delivery timeframes remain achievable and on track for the remainder of the programme ,,,,,,,,,The project is subject to monthly assurance in the shape of the PMO Programme Delivery Group (PDG) as well as an agreed Gate 2 pre ITT and the Franchising Programme (of which this project is a constituent part) undergoes an annual Gate 0. ,,,,,,The project is subject to monthly assurance in the shape of the PMO Programme delivery Group (PDG) as well as an agreed Gate 2 pre ITT and the Franchising Programme (of which this project is a constituent part) undergoes an annual Gate 0. ,Internal - Amber: Assurance and approvals are in place and scheduled:  9 Aug - RIB consultation; 11 - 17 Aug - CoE clearance; 1 Sep - BICC approval ; 5 Sep - Ministers approval; 10 Oct - Treasury approval; Nov 2016 - ITT publication for west coast; April 2017 - ITT publication for Southeastern; May 2017 - ITT publication for East Midland.
