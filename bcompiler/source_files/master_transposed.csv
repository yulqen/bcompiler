Modernising the route will improve the experience of everyone who uses it and stimulate economics growth in the south west and beyond.,"The project fulfils the Secretary of State's rail investment strategy (also known as HLOS) capacity requirement published in 2012 for this area of the network as well as the Manifesto Commitment ""between the years 2014 and 2019 over �38 billion will be invested in Britain�s rail network across operations maintenance and renewals (OMR) and enhancements (infrastructure upgrades)"". The proposal addresses historic under-provision of capacity to meet current demand as well as forecast demand in CP5.  By 2018/19 it is estimated that almost 50% more seats would be needed in the peak morning period into Paddington to accommodate forecast demand (HLOS).

The order supports a new train factory at Newton Aycliffe which will create 730 new jobs with thousands more in the supply chain. IEP serves London to Bristol Cardiff Swansea Cheltenham & Worcester and London to Leeds Edinburgh & Aberdeen offering through-trains from non-electrified lines without the need to change or attach a locomotive.,and tackle congestion - IEP will deliver more trains with more seats and faster journeys improving connectivity to and from London and between cities. Support regional economic developments - IEP creates 730 new skilled jobs at Newton Aycliffe in the North East and secures thousands more in the UK supply chain.Make the most of our current infrastructure - IEP uses the electrified railway fully by minimising diesel operation under the wires.

This programme is made up of the Wessex Capacity Programme (WCP) which includes the enhancements works at Waterloo station and the rolling stock procurement.

The project together with the related infrastructure works at Waterloo and along the South West Route fulfils the Secretary of State's rail investment strategy (also known as HLOS) capacity requirement published in 2012 for this area of the network. If data is shown in a comparable way these are the most overcrowded train services in Great Britain and are forecast to have continuing high levels of growth.
