Governance papers for full funding have been to and approved by Investment Decision Committee Higways England Board and Board Investment and Commerical Committee. The Ministerial submission has been approved and notification from HMT that funds are available has been received. The full SGAR 5 was held in on 28 June 2016 which achieved a GREEN rating. The I&PA review provisionally booked as a two day review has been cancelled and will not be held; this has been agreed by all parties due to our response to the Feburary 16 review. An AAP review was scheduled but IPA were unable to source one of the reviewers from the previous review due to unavailability (a previous reviewer is required for continuity). Kate Walker IPA Ops Lead talked the requirement through with Chris Taylor and it was agreed that it would not need to be rescheduled (presumed due to confirmation that previous recommendations were being adequately actioned). The project is currently working through a cost assurance exercise with the delivery partners prior to Notice to Proceed being issued. The project is well placed to start works before the December 2016 milestone. The main risks to the overall scheme at present are: H&S risk to workers during construction; Excessive customer delays through road work;County Archaeologist does not relax present requirements; Poor weather in key construction phases; Overheating of construction market; lack of skills materials plant; Client capability to lead and manage project;Unknown impact of the UK referendum to leave the EU,,,,,,,Chris Taylor,Christopher.taylor@highwaysengland.co.uk,07795 120563,,Cohort 14,,Not Eligible - Contractor,,26/03/2015,,,,,,,John Worthington,John.Worthington@macegroup.com,07920 761680,,Cohort 14,,Not Eligible - Contractor,,,,14,14.2,32.2,Amber,Amber,An Integrated Delivery team (IDT) has been established between the Highways England four contractors in two JVs and two designers as a single design entity; the IDT will be responsible for completing the design of the scheme and for carrying out its construction and commissioning between 2016 and 2020. Highways England has a dual role on the project: as the Client (Core and Support Teams); and as an equal Partner within the IDT itself.These two roles are distinct; Highways England acts as the £client£ function which sits outside the IDT to represent the interests of Highways England and is to be differentiated to the equal Partner within the IDT along with the detailed design consultant and the contractors. The Highways England A14 project team operates as Client function and acts as a gateway for accessing on behalf of the wider project team the various service functions within Highways England and for leading on governance and assurance functions. Resource planning within Highway£s England is constantly ongoing. As well as a core Highways England team resource is being utilised from the Programme Delivery Partner Framework to build internal capability and capacity. Elements of the role of PDP also includes formal and structured learning on-the-job learning and mentoring to support the development of Highways England personnel on the porject. Due to these ongoing activities and the unknown potential for success in recruiting the right resource the project is content to report a 'Amber' against resourcing.,N/A,N/A,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,Amber,,Green,green,,,,,,,,,,Other capability includes Project Management Office Health & Safety Stakeholder Communications Lands and Legacy. The client team consists of both Highways England staff and staff sourced through the Programme Delivery Partner or PSF/CDF consultancy. In general the non-Highways England posts are the more senior positions. Recruitment of a Highways England Project Director is critical to success; the executive search is on its third iteration to identify a PD. Salary is showing to be a barrier to attracting the right quality candidate. A recruitment exercise is currently underway and it is hopeful that a successful candidate will be identified and appointed as Highways England PD to the project . A Highways England Project Manager started on the 27 June 2016. Complex Infrastucture Programme are currently working on a workforce plan to recruit and fill key posts  in 2016/17. As recognised by the I&PA review (Attachment 5) the client team capacity capability and collaborative behaviours are key for success. In addition to the current recruitment a workforce review and behaviour plan is being produced.Work force planning is currently underway with the IDT determining both workforce and management requirements in order to deliver the scheme in line with the programme. The current analysis suggests we will have a work force that peaks at c. 2000 and a management team that peaks at 500 which includes the Highways England representatives. These figures are derived from resourcing the construction programme which has been smoothed to make the most efficient utilisation of available resource. We will  also review the impact of these requirements against other projects that will be undertaken within a similar time period.,Execute,,Full Business Case,Full Business Case,12/03/2015,n/a,n/a,SOBC BICC Approval,,,,,,SOBC HMT Approval,,,,,,OBC BICC Approval,,,,,,OBC HMT Approval,,,,,,Planning Consent,,,,,,Pre-PIN,,,,,,pre-OJEU,,,,,,Shortlisting,,,,,,Selection,,,,,,FBC BICC Approval,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Start of project,,,,,,Start of Constuction,,,,,,Start of Operations,,,,,,Project End Date,,,,,,Business Case End Date,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nominal,Nominal,4.08,public finance,2393,1382.1,0,1492.3,0,1492.3,,,,,,,,,There are no RDEL cost for the project,The latest range estimate for the scheme is £1.193bn to £1.662bn with a most likely value of £1.435bn.

This work was completed in June 2016 and the planning assumption of an announcement of preferred scheme by Summer 2016 has been put back to at least October 2016 in line with SoS's statement in the House of Commons on 30 June 2016. However given recent political activities the programme team are preparing to be ready as required by Ministers.The planning route to enable increased airport capacity is expected to be through a National Policy Statement. During this period work has also been ongoing to draft a generic airports NPS and consider how best to deliver a consultation on this NPS. This work was due to complete by Summer 2016 and was assured through a PAR completed in June specifically on the challenge of a large consultation on the NPS - Rating: Amber. The scheme planning and construction activities will be delivered by the preferred scheme promoter however DfT will work closely with the promoter to enable the programme and manage dependencies. It is currently presumed that the scheme promoter will fund the scheme and some elements of surface access. No public funding is currently available for direct investment in airports.The key strategic risks are identified as: a) Government's strategic and policy priorities change impacting on airport capacity; b) The impact of Air Quality on the programme and the ability to deliver expansion within legal air quality limits which could result in delayed policy implementation and capacity delivery; c) Delivery and funding of planned or assumed surface access proposals which could result in the full anticipated benefits and generation of additional airport capacity not being realised; and d) Economic regulation framework impacting on the deliverability of any Government decision on airport expansion meaning a change in primary legislation is necessary.The Airport Capacity Programme is novel and contentious and will be subject to continual political public local national and global media interest as well as ongoing opposition and legal challenge.,,,,,,,Caroline Low,caroline.low@dft.gsi.gov.uk,020 7944 6261,,Eligible - other/awaiting cohort,Unable to commit to  course because of residential module expectations interfering with family commitments.,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,04/02/2016,,,,,,,Sacha Hatteea (DD - ACAP Delivery) Rupesh Mehta (DD - ACAP Policy),Sacha.Hatteea@dft.gsi.gov.uk Rupesh.Mehta@dft.gsi.gov.uk,020 7944 6313 (SH) / 2708 (RM),,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,,,53.3,1,65.3,Green,Amber,Covers ACD resource.

Steel Procurement Narrative: This project is not expected to be publicly funded but the private sector airport developer is likely to spend well in excess of £10m on steel-based products as part of the new terminal infrastructure needed to support a further runway. This assertion is based on benchmarking with the Heathrow Terminal 5 scheme where we understand up to £150m was spent on Corus/TATA supplied steel alone. However construction is unlikely to begin until after 2020. Government will set out the national policy need for the construction of new airport capacity through an Airports NPS and therefore government may seek to influence scheme delivery. The CAA will also have an interest in efficient procurement in its role as economic regulator ensuring the passenger only bears efficiently incurred costs.,No costs are stated under CDEL as a decision on preferred scheme has not been taken and therefore full programme cost is not clear at present. The current expectation is that the scheme will be funded by the private sector.The Airports Commission assessed costs attributed to the different expansion options.

Within this there are concerns regarding escalating costs particularly on the Network Rail portion of the works. Increased scrutinity and measures to help control costs are being implemented.Schedule - At the end of Period 2 in 2016 Crossrail (CRL) is reporting 75% complete against a plan of 76.6% a variance of 1.6%. The Surface Works delivered by Network Rail are now 65% complete. The Master Operations Handover Schedule (MOHS) was launched during April 2015 and replaces the Master Control Schedule (MCS) as the primary schedule. This is expected to improve the strategic management and integration of activities necessary to deliver Crossrail as an end-to-end railway.Tunnelling Progress -  Now complete. Stations and tunnels fit-out - The focus continues on the handover to system wide contractors and with this work is underway on the tunnel and station fit out works. Rolling Stock - A recovery plan is in place in response to falling behind the schedule for cab manufacture. Full recovery to schedule is forecast for 1 October 2016. Emerging issues arising with installation of signalling software for trains running on Heathrow Spur that could impact commencement of services to Heathrow in May 2018. This has been escalated between TfL and Bombardier senior management with regular reports being provided to DfT. Dates for unit testing at Derby Old Dalby and On Network being held. Key Risks - The cost escalation risk mentioned above can be broken down to the risk that engineering contracts are not in line with Crossrail Ltd forecasts and that escalation of Network Rail costs result in the need for DfT  to provide additional funding. Additional risks include pressures to change the existing scope of the project during the construction phase; suitable agreement is not reached with Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL) on issue of Heathrow Access Regulation; agreement over additional Crossrail services and the impact on other services.,,,,,,,Matthew Lodge,matthew.lodge@dft.gsi.gov.uk,020 7944 6224,,Cohort 13,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,,,,,,,,Graham Stockbridge,graham.stockbridge@dft.gsi.gov.uk,020 7944 2551,,Cohort 13,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,,,8.33,0,9.33,Green,Green,0.33 represents PA shared across the Directorate.

Spending takes into account reviewed figures from September 2015 Mid-Year Review.,These figures reflect the project to construct the Crossrail railway only and exclude the contract to deliver the rolling stock and depots.It is important to note that the budgeted figures provided above reflect when TfL and DfT make contractualised contributions into the Crossrail Ltd account. It is assumed that the budgeted figures reflect when the investment is made. The forecast figures provided are taken from the Crossrail Investment Model (May 2016 with the next one available in November 2016) and reflect when Crossrail Ltd actually incurs expenditure at P95 confidence levels. Therefore the budget and forecast figures will not match.Forecast costs have risen since the last quarter due to (i) the culmination of discussions between contractors and Crossrail Ltd in closing out contracts; and (ii) falling interest rates. However Crossrail Ltd continues to take steps to prevent further increases in forecasts and the Project Representative is closely monitoring Crossrail Ltd£s performance to provide the Department with ongoing assurance.Government CDEL also includes On Network Works figures (incurred by Network Rail) the cost of which was defined in 2011 at Review Point 4 (the point at which both Sponsors reviewed their contributions to the project). The £200m income in 2016/17 is a City of London contribution which will be paid to DfT on completion of a number of project milestones. This is currently forecast for 2016/17 but there is a risk this could slip in to 2017/18. The £70m income in 17/18 is a contribution from Heathrow Airport Ltd which will be paid to DfT once milestones relating to the Crossrail services to Heathrow are completed.

The figure of £19.8bn has been taken from the latest business case (2011). The difference between £11bn and £19.8bn reflects wider economic benefits of £8.8bn (2002 prices). BICC/GMPP reporting guidance from the BICC team notes that £Indirect Tax Revenues£ should be categorised as Government-Cashable benefits.There are limited negative benefits for Indirect Tax Revenues now shown separately due to updated guidance. Indirect tax revenues will be foregone as a result of less fuel paid as passengers switch from road to rail and less VAT associated with expenditure foregone to pay rail fares.

This is a high priority programme which was reviewed as part of the Hendy Review. Current progress for this quarter includes successful Late May Bank holiday works with key highlights such as the complete removal of West Ealing sidings multiple bridges successfully replaced OLE installations by Crossrail and The Greater West programmes and 1.1 miles of Up Main renewed on the Bristol Parkway to Gloucester line.  Additional Late Summer works in Hinksey blockades are planned for 30 July to 15 August which will involve signalling flood alleviation track renewal and bridge replacement works. The next key infrastructure milestone (IEP Test track -RS3) between Reading to Didcot is expected to be met on September 2016. Through better management and improved governance processes the team is making good progress in the programme. However there are still significant overall concerns over the confirmation of required outputs cost escalation and risks to timely delivery of the electrification programme that the team are currently working to mitigate . A snapshot of key works include: EP Test track deliverability £ The Test Track is proceeding well and the mains are currently treated as live.  Overhead Line Electrification is progressing but Network Rail will need more access to tracks and depots between August and September which they will be negotiating with operators.  This is critical for meeting the NR commitment to deliver depot electrification for 30 Sep 2016 and completion of the test track; National SCADA programme (Supervisory control and data acquisition) £ This should have been in place by now however there are issues regarding user acceptance.  A mandraulic solution will be used for the short-term and mitigations are being investigated for the longer-term if acceptance cannot be obtained quickly.  This has the potential to significantly affect the delivery of the Programme and the rolling stock cascade; Steventon Bridge £ Additional work has been commissioned in order to ensure a strong case is submitted to English Heritage in order to gain approval for the removal of Steventon Bridge; Severn Tunnel £ The T-10 review has shown NR are on track for the successful delivery of works during the blockade from 12th September £ 21st October. During the period of distruption rail users will be diverted via Gloucester or use replacement buses; Goring Gap - NR are working up 3-4 options for stakeholders to review followed by a public consultation in September. A solution is anticipated by the end of the year but it is unclear when possession and workforce will be able to retrofit; Christmas 2016 works - There are not enough resources equipment or access to complete the Xmas works fully. NR is considering fallback actions including considering alternative means of delivering the scope or bringing forward sections of the work.

We anticipate the business case will be completed within the next 6 months. The Great Western Second Direct Award is in effect the initial procurement strategy for delivery of most of the benefits of the GWRM programme itself and represents an affordable commercially sound and sustainable way of providing the Great Western franchised services from the target implementation date of 20 September 2015 until 31 March 2019. A cost benefit analysis was undertaken in the GW Integrated Full Business Case.  NPV of 3000 (2010 £m) has been quoted above in the Cost section and a PVB baseline of 5100 (2010 £M) has been quoted as the 'Remaining Unprofiled benefits to the project' as the Business case document does not detail the benefits by years so we are unable to report this information here.  Please note that due to the Hendy replan this analysis has since been superseded by ongoing discussions with NR/GWR and modifications to the DA terms. Therefore this data has been included for reference. The new analysis has not yet been approved but there is the intention to update the business case when the Hendy baseline has been confirmed.

This will provide close scrutiny of the Programme.  After discussion with the IPA a Gate 0 will be deferred until 2017 to avoid duplication.  Separately Network Rail is performing its own Gateway-style reviews on Programmes in the Enhancements portfolio and the results will be shared.  All actions and recommendations received from any assurance reviews and approvals bodies will be tracked and progress monitored with regular reporting to the SRO.  A GIAA Review was carried out in April 2015 which made a number of recommendations.  Since then a new governance structure has been established between DfT and NR which allows greater joint assurance of the programme and the structure of Programme and Portfolio boards enables the SRO to monitor progress carefully.  The Hendy review examined the work contained in the Programme and has re-baselined and redefined the scope.  An IAAP is currently being produced which will set out the assurance and approvals framework for the programme.,Amber Green,Amber Green,The Programme has identified appropriate assurance and approvals.

As such the current delivery confidence status is AMBER. PHASE 1:The hybrid Bill remains on track for Royal Assent by Dec 2016. 2nd Reading in the Lords took place on 14 April and the Lords Select Committee (appointed during May) heard locus cases from 7 June to 11 July. Petitioner hearings started on 5 July and are expected to continue until end Oct; ITTs for the MWCC were issued on 8 June; RP1 has been concluded with a letter sent from David Prout to Simon Kirby on 1 June to formally complete the process and set out expectations and requirements for the period to RP2. The key challenge for Phase 1 is to increase the schedule delivery confidence from 60% to nearer 80%. HS2 Ltd have been commissioned to address this and will report back in Sept. PHASE 2: Work has started to plan and develop the material to support the Phase 2a hybrid Bill which we aim to lay in Parliament in summer 2017 and we continue to prepare advice for the Secretary of State to inform a decision on the Phase 2b route this autumn; Sir David Higgins published his recommendations on the route through South Yorkshire in July; The Secretary of State agreed to revise the remit to Network Rail for Crewe and clarified the need to find an option that can be delivered for less than £500m. The key challenge for Phase 2 is to ensure the scheme is affordable within the existing SR15 settlement. For Phase 1 and 2 there is also a key challenge around ensuring that Network Rail has the capacity to develop the On Network Works to support the programme and that they are delivered on time.COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS: Integrated Decisions Plan produced bringing together all decisions relating to Rolling Stock & Depots and Future Operations and Classic Rail Interface projects over the next 18 months. WIDER PROGRAMME: The IPA led a Periodic Update to assess HS2 Ltd's efficiency plans - circa £9bn worth of potential saving opportunities identified across the programme. NAO report on the progress of HS2 published on 28 June described HS2 as a large complex and ambitious programme that was facing cost and time pressures. However the report also recognised the cost savings identified that the strategic context and objectives were now more clearly demonstrated than since the previous report and that HS2 was making good progress and was on course to gain the powers needed to start building the railway by the end of the year.,,,,,,,David Prout,David.Prout@dft.gsi.gov.uk,020 7944 2112,,Other,Participated in Cohort 1 by agreement for one day,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,18/09/2015,,,,,,,Paul Rodgers Cavendish Elithorn Nick Bisson Michael Hurn Caroline Botwood,,,,Cohort 4,Joanathan Sharrock - Cohort7Nick Bisson - Cohort 14Michael Hurn - Cohort 1Caroline Botwood - Cohort 16Cav Elithorn - Cohort,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,,,131.2,15,172.7,Amber,Amber,Headcount figures include all consultants and contractors and commercial fast streamers.

Following the precedent set by Phase One we will capitalise expenditure following second reading of the Bill for Phase 2a and the remainder of Phase Two £ our prudent assumption is that this will be from April 2018 and April 2020 respectively.,The 15/16 budget is a product of revised corporate planning round. In the 2015 Spending Review (SR15) Government restated the long-term funding envelope for the HS2 programme at £55.7bn in 2015 prices. This budget is for delivery of the full HS2 scheme including rolling stock. The SR15 settlement set a year by year funding allocation for HS2 for a period of 5 years (2016/17 to 2020/21) including an allowance for inflation.In summary the total funding envelope of £55.7bn (in 2015 prices) is in Real Terms whereas in comparison the funding allocated for years 16/17 to 20/21 is in Nominal terms.For the purposes of this spreadsheet only WLC refers to the total funding envelope of the HS2 programme.

Diesel tests continue;Network Rail: Programme of gauge enhancements platform works and power upgrades continue; Communications: Launch event for GWR fleet on 30th June 2016; Finance: On budget. Finance options for bi-mode variation will be put to Ministers this Autumn. Top Project Risks 1. GWR and then VTEC trains 100 days late as a result of NR's delayed completion of test track between Reading and Didcot with potential for Liquidated Damages of £200m. Mitigations to reduce delay under assessment during July 2016. GW Change Team kept informed as existing fleet needs to be kept longer. 2.  Industrial relations problems associated with changing work practices. Response lead by TOCs and dormant at present. Kept under review in context of GTR. 3. Train design does not meet specification. Managed through monthly Delivery Review with Agility Trains and Hitachi. DfT's speciliast technical advisors used for assurance that the train meets our requirements. 4.

The scope of this assessment includes consideration of the best location route aligment type of crossing structure (i.e. bridge versus tunnel) and financing (inc. charging and the potential for private sector involvement).,Following a DfT-led public consultation in 2013 the need for a new road crossing in the Lower Thames region was included in the National Infrastructure Plan in 2014.  In addition to addressing the problems caused by congestion and unreliable journeys improvements in road crossing capacity are also required to support economic growth and improve environmental impacts.,Infrastructure,,,,,No,,Supporting economic growth,Monetised Benefit,More free-flowing network,Monetised Benefit,Accessible and integrated network,Non-Monetised Benefit,Improved environment,Non-Monetised Benefit,Safe and serviceable network,Monetised Benefit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,High,,Amber,"Work is continuing on the Options phase with an approved scope and programme of work. Four front running options one at A and three at C have been identified. In June 2015 these and the rationale for their selection were shared with Highways England Board DfT (BICC & Special Advisors) and with the Roads Minister. A proposed solution was approved by the Highways England Board in October 2015.  Approval to proceed with non-statutory public consultation was obtained from BICC on 18 Jan 2016 and consultation started on 26 Jan 2016.  The SGAR 1 was undertaken in Nov 2015 and the project was rated ""amber"" pending completion of non-critical deliverables at that time.  Funding: £29.7m of options funding has been approved and is sufficient for the remainder of the Options Phase. BICC approved an initial tranche of development phase funding in Feb 2016. A Technical Partner was appointed for the remainder of the project on 6 May 2016.  The Project is in the process of analysing the response to consulation in order to develop a Preferred Route Recommendation.Summary : The project is on track to deliver a preferred route recommendation to DfT during Q4 of 2016.  Risks 1. Insufficient political support  with the result that the project is not considered to be a priority over other investments.  Mitigation - The Project is working with DfT officials to ensure that benefits are well articulated and understood in both DfT and HM Treasury and clearly described in the Outline Business Case.   2.Objectors to the Project may seek a Judicial Review leading to dealys and additional costs.  Mitigation - The Project has consulted with stakeholders during the development and assessment of options and has strictly adhered to a consultation process which has been developed with legal advice and assured by the Consultation Institute (there is a clear audit trail of analysis and decision making). 3. The Preferred Route Annoucement could be delayed pending DfT and HMT agreement regarding financing (public v private).  Mitigation - The Project is supporting DfT in its discussions with HM Treasury and ensuring that both parties are aware of the impact on the cost and delivery schedule.",,,,,,,Chris Taylor,christopher.taylor@highwaysengland.co.uk,01306 876176,,Cohort 14,,Not Eligible - Contractor,,09/10/2014,,,,,,,Mike Brown,michael.s.brown@uk.pwc.com,07711 771 357,,Cohort 14,,Not Eligible - Contractor,,,,10.25,8.7,23.95,Green,Amber,Figures above depict the Project Management & PMO Team there are numerous partners / suppliers totalling over 100 that are working in the project.

Progress update/Key Risks and Issues: North of England: The NoE Programme remains challenging; Workshops have been held to align with NR programme with franchise proposals with an improving position for electrification between Manchester and Blackpool; The next key infrastructure milestone in the North of England (Calder Valley West) is on target for delivery for December 2016. Construction is progressing on key elements of programme: including Ordsall Chord (on time for December 2017) and electrification (Manchester to Blackpool in phases for December 2017/May 2018); Some complex issues are outstanding(e.g. power supply); Cost escalation concerns emerging around power supply and new electrification standards; Waiting for a decision on Transport and Works Act Orders: - Manchester Oxford Road Piccadilly and Hope Valley; The delay to the electrification could further impact on the availability of cascaded diesel rolling stock to deliver franchise commitments. Transpennine Route Upgrade: There has been good progress on the Transpennine Route Upgrade as the Client Development Remit was signed on 8 July 2016.  It establishes the basis for Network Rail development work which should report in December 2017.  A full funding application based on this development work is due to be submitted in early spring 2018 to authorise funding beyond April 2019 to completion;£ Emerging concern regarding interaction between Clients ( DfT and Rail North) aspirations for delivery by December 2022 and NR proposed programme.

This programme is made up of the Wessex Capacity Programme (WCP) which includes the enhancements works at Waterloo station and the rolling stock procurement. Collectively the whole South West Route Capacity programme is referred to as the Wessex Capacity Improvement Programme  (WCIP) by Network Rail.,"The programme is part of the manifesto commitment to ""Improve connections to the South West with major investment in the M5 A358 A30 A303 and the electrification of the Great Western Main Line and bring in new fast trains on the route"". The project together with the related infrastructure works at Waterloo and along the South West Route fulfils the Secretary of State's rail investment strategy (also known as HLOS) capacity requirement published in 2012 for this area of the network. If data is shown in a comparable way these are the most overcrowded train services in Great Britain and are forecast to have continuing high levels of growth. The proposal addresses historic under-provision of capacity to meet current demand as well as forecast demand in CP5.

Steps have been taken through the programme board and Enhancements Portfolio Board to manage and mitigate some cost escalation (c£90m) reported on this programme in early 2016.  As a result the projected CP5 (2014-2019) cost for the programme has returned to the 2015 Hendy baseline (although the CP6 forecast cost has consequently increased by c.£30M).   The South Western franchise ITT went out on the 30 June 2016 and working closely with the franchise colleagues in monitoring impacts that may rise relating to the infrastructure programme.

The cost figures for Non-Gov costs are in 12/13 prices and reflect the Network Rail enhancement forecasts for the Wessex Capacity programme. The projects in scope for these costs include Waterloo; Wessex Traction Power Supply Upgrade; Reading Ascot to London Waterloo train lengthening; and CP4 rollover schemes including Route 3 Power sign off Package 7 10 Car South West Suburban Railway Wessex ASDO.

This is currently the key Risk on the project as other cab-fitment activities require the test facility to be available by Q4 2018.Overall the project is forecast to come in within the Hendy set budget of £133.5m in CP5 (12/13 prices).,,,,,,,Brian Etheridge,brian.etheridge@dft.gsi.gov.uk,0207 944 4059,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,SRO letter is being drafted.,,,,,,,Farha Sheikh,Farha.Sheikh@dft.gsi.gov.uk,0207 944 2921,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,,,1.5,0,4.5,Amber,Green,The project is currently under resourced.

The Live Service support desk (SIAM) and end user device and LAN support went live during Nov 2015.  During April & May the programme decided to bring together End User Computing WAN Unified Messaging Platform and Tech Refresh into a super-project entitled NED (Networks Email & Devices).  The purpose of this was to further integrate the projects ensuring a joined up approach to delivery and optimising a good end user experience.  This has impacted some of the timescales for the projects against the original Business Case.  Exception reports are to be submitted in July to re-baseline the project plans.The NED Project has now delivered new desktop / laptop devices has delivered c.1750 desktops to users so far and is currently testing other types of devices.  Deployment of laptops are planned to start in August.  It has also delivered over 2500 user mailboxes.  NED has also completed the replacement of the Capita and Atos legacy WAN services.  Only the legacy Driving Test Centre network now needs to be migrated and this part of the NED Project will be closed and handed over to Live Services to manage in the next quarter.  The Application Development Support & Hosting (ADSH) AWS (Amazon Web Services) Legacy VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) scripting is complete and AWS Legacy environments have been created in Non-Production.

At the time of completing this form (mid-July) we have received informal advice from Transport for London that the scheme costs have increased by £40m and that TfL is considering options which include asking the new Mayor of London whether he wishes to revoke the previous Mayor's support for the scheme.  Based on a discussion with officials (12th July) the SofS was strongly of the view that DfT must hold TfL to the agreement that they (TfL) pay all cost overruns.  He indicated that if TfL took a London-centric approach to Croxley this must call into question the Mayor's aspirations to take over suburban rail services.  The scheme was formally handed over from Hertfordshire County Council to Transport for London / London Underground Ltd in November 2015 and delivery is currently mandated by directions from the Mayor of London (March and November 2015) which include a 100% pain/gain for TfL on any increase/decrease in the cost of the scheme.  Pending completion of a scope/cost review and completion of procurement (both being undertaken by TfL) construction is due to start in autumn 2016 and complete in 2020.

The Development Consent Order (DCO) application was submitted in March 2015. The DCO examination period ended on 3 March 2016 and the Examining Authorities report was submitted to the Secretary of State on 3 June 2016.  A decision from the Secretary of State is due 3 September 2016.  Project delivery is likely once the outcome of the DCO process is known.  We have retained one of the existing designers who carried out the preliminary design during DCO to ensure that knowledge is not lost and to mitigate risks in this area. The main risks to the DCO is Air Quality and whether mitigation is required and the Transport Select Committee's report on All lane running. HE Legal and PTSD were supporting the DCO process in order to mitigate the air quality risk.  The detailed designer and contractor were awarded under the Collaborative Delivery Framework in July 2015 to maintain programme and start works once the decision is made on the DCo submission.  The contractor was asked to re-assess the DCO construction programme and review the benefits of changing this to shorten the construction period and the traffic managment lengths thereby improving the impacts on the travelling public. This work was carried out and programme 2A is considered the best option which shortens the construction period to 50 months and proposes to use a greater number of shorter length and duration traffic management to address customer concerns regarding long lengths of traffic management. A new Scheme Estimate for the Scheme has just been produced (29 June 2016) which has increased the forecast outturn of the scheme to £889.6m (central estimate including Programme Risk) from £714.5m (central estimate including programme risk).  The scheme will need approval for the new scheme estimate through IDC HE Board and BICC (September 2016) until this has been approved all costs in Financial information are based on the £714.5 estimate which hass been approved through BICC.,,,,,,,Lorraine Butler,lorraine.butler@highwaysengland.co.uk,0300 470 3578,,,,,,12/05/2015,,,,,,,Ian Parker,Ian.Parker@macegroup.com,,,,,,,,,4.9,1,7.7,Green,Green,,,,,,Green,Green,Green,Green,Green,Green,,,,Green,Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Define and refine plan,,Outline Business Case,Outline Business Case,13/12/2013,,11/07/2016,,,,,,,Start of Construction,01/11/2016,,02/01/2017,Project,,Start of Operation,01/11/2022,,01/10/2021,Project,Currently forecasting OFT earlier than planned due to anticipated efficiency in construction..

The on-train equipment that provides Wi-Fi is reliant on the availability of the mobile operator£s signal to connect the train to the internet.  The mobile connectivity on rail project addresses this. The team has developed a TOC-led approach to be delivered through obligations in new franchises. The approach was endorsed by Ministers. We are currently developing an OBC which will include an output based specification design to focus enhancements where they will generate a financial return. The key risks are the use of the residual value mechanism in franchise as the investment could take over 10 years to pay back and the reliance on Network Rail to develop a plan for how it will provide access and services for telecoms suppliers working for train operators.,,,,,,,Brian Etheridge,Brian.Etheridge@DfT.gsi.gov.uk,0207 944 4059,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,,,,,,,,Farha Sheikh,Farha.Sheikh@dft.gsi.gov.uk,0207 944 2921,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,Eligible - awaiting cohort,,,,1.15,1,2.15,Amber,Green,Currently recruiting a G7 to replace contractor.,,,,,,,Amber,Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Define and refine plan,,No Business Case,No Business Case,,Draft OBC is being prepared for submission to BICC on 1st Sep.,OBC is due to be approved in BICC on 1st Sep,Start of Project,01/05/2015,,01/05/2015,Project,,Start of Construction- East Midlands,01/12/2016,,01/12/2016,Project," Please replace  ""start of Construction"" with  ITT starts - East Midland",Start of Operation - East Midlands,01/03/2018,,01/03/2018,Project," Please replace  ""start of Operation"" with Franchise Starts - East Midland",SOBC - BICC Approval,,,,,SOBC was not submitted due to limited current evidence to support SOBC.,SOBC - HMT Approval,,,,,,OBC - BICC Approval,01/09/2016 00:00,,01/09/2016 00:00,Approval - Departmental (BICC),,OBC - HMT Approval,10/10/2016 00:00,,10/10/2016 00:00,Approval - HMT Other,,FBC - BICC Approval,,,,,ToC-led approach FBC will be part of new Franchise Award.,FBC - HMT Approval,,,,,ToC-led approach FBC will be part of new Franchise Award.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Real,Real,3.50%,,6.3bn,-220m,56,50,0,106,,,,,,,,,Budget was allocated in Spending Review.

Velocity and vendor performance are consistent across all workstreams and are showing a gradual increase. The project is delivering value in the form of working software released to Live multiple times each sprint across application database infrastructure and data quality. Over 130 releases to Live have been made since the legacy MOT1 service was retired in late September 2015. A recent peer review by GDS described MOT Phase B as 'an exemplar of how to run a proper agile project' and 'one of the best agile projects we have seen in flight in government to-date' Project delivery improvement has been supported by the new Agile Governance work (commenced in January 2016). The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of this framework is now in place on MOT delivering improved controls and assurance artefacts around agile process and software delivery including delivery roadmap (replacing legacy waterfall project plans) spend tracker (tracking spend for all vendors across all teams and workstreams sprint by sprint) and release plans covering releases of software to Live. The project continued to make good progress during Quarter 1 2016/17 in delivering further enhancements to the new MOT Testing Service application. Key service improvements included delivering functionality to support the rollout of the MOT Training Education and Skills Support (MTESS) service capabilities to support CPMS robustness and SPMS ( Slot Purchase management system) users and development of limited 2-Factor Authentication for early testing with users. Alongside the delivered application improvements the project has continued to refine its service design process to ensure that new features are based on insights from data and are researched and tested with users before development starts. The team has also made good progress in reducing defects by conducting more in-Sprint testing in the development environments enabling early identification and resolution by developers prior to promotion for release. The Common Payments (CPMS) team delivered the robustness features which will improve the communication between MOT and CPMS reducing the timescales for direct debit delivery.  The CPMS code base used by MOT and OLCS are being merged and tested to deliver a single code base reducing the total cost of ownership. The WebOps team have delivered resiliency capability and infrastructure streamlining is reducing the complexity of the architecture and lowering the cost.

Since then NR has undertaken extensive and detailed work to assess the  asset classes in Plan A of the strategy - which were estimated to have potential to release £1.8bn of Public Sector Net Borrowing (deficit reducing receipts net of costs and taxes). NR's team have worked tirelessly to review all options and develop Business Cases. Analysis to date illustrates how difficult it will be to structure a transactions in a way that works for the stringent ESA 10 rules governing PSNB while protecting the operational railway and delivering value for money. NR has forecasted it will be very challenginge to score more than £300m PSNB proceeds in CP5; NR's next steps to address this potential shortfall in receipts will include: progressing work on the business cases for assets within Plan A; putting the first batch of SOBCs to its Property Board in July for endorsement. NR's project teams will recommend progressing work with a view to carving out any assets and transactions that can score for PSNB (as well as protecting the railway and delivering value for money); considering options for raising cash (e.g. PSND debt reducing proceeds) where PNSB is not achieveable. A relaxation of the accounting requirements would make it possible to raise proceeds through more flexible deal structures such as leases which would enable them to manage operational interfaces; accelerating work on other potential transactions for station retail assets. At present DFT are supporting NR to scope the scale of proceeds NR could achieve from this option;NR will update BICC 18 July on asset disposals (and enhancements).  NR's Board will be reviewing the overall net position in relation to Hendy OMR and Asset Disposals in September before bringing forward its plans for managing delivery and pressures.
